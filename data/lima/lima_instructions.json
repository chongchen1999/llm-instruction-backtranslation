    "response": "The question is relatively broad and one should take into account that the brain not only consists of neurons, but also glial cells (supportive cells) and pre-mitotic neuronal stem cells. Furthermore, as critical fellow-scientists have indicated, developmental stage is very important, as the developing embryonic brain is very different from the adult brain.\nHowever, after sifting through various publications, the answer to the question is actually remarkably simple: Yes, brain cells migrate.\nIn  the adult brain glial cells migrate in the brain (Klämbt, 2009). Glial cells are involved in a myriad of functions, but a notable example of migrating glial cells are the oligodendrocytes that migrate relative long distances to find their target axons onto which they wrap themselves to form the insulating myelin sheath (Tsai and Miller, 2002).\nNeuronal stem cells migrate over long distances in response to injury (Imitola et al., 2004) and they migrate from specific stem-cell locations (e.g., hippocampus and subventricular zone) to other regions (Clarke, 2003).\nPost-mitotic, but non-differentiated neurons have been shown to migrate in the adult brain in fish (Scott et al., 2012), and in mammals and non-human primates as well (Sawada et al., 2011).\nNot surprisingly, glial cells, stem cells and neurons also migrate during embryonic development. Most notably, post-mitotic neurons destined to fulfill peripheral functions have to migrate over relatively long distances from the neural crest to their target locations (Neuroscience, 2nd ed, Neuronal Migration)."

    "response": "There is a general historical trend.\nIn the olden days, memories were small, and so programs were perforce small. Also, compilers were not very smart, and many programs were written in assembler, so it was considered a good thing to be able to write a program using few instructions. Instruction pipelines were simple, and processors grabbed one instruction at a time to execute it. The machinery inside the processor was quite complex anyway; decoding instructions was not felt to be much of a burden. \nIn the 1970s, CPU and compiler designers realized that having such complex instructions was not so helpful after all. It was difficult to design processors in which those instructions were really efficient, and it was difficult to design compilers that really took advantage of these instructions. Chip area and compiler complexity was better spent on more generic pursuits such as more general-purpose registers. The Wikipedia article on RISC explains this in more detail.\nMIPS is the ultimate RISC architecture, which is why it's taught so often.\nThe x86 family is a bit different. It was originally a CISC architecture meant for systems with very small memory (no room for large instructions), and has undergone many successive versions. Today's x86 instruction set is not only complicated because it's CISC, but because it's really a 8088 with a 80386 with a Pentium possibly with an x86_64 processor.\nIn today's world, RISC and CISC are no longer the black-and-white distinction they might have been once. Most CPU architectures have evolved to different shades of grey.\nOn the RISC side, some modern MIPS variants have added multiplication and division instructions, with a non-uniform encoding. ARM processors have become more complex: many of them have a 16-bit instruction set called Thumb in addition to the “original” 32-bit instructions, not to mention Jazelle to execute JVM instructions on the CPU. Modern ARM processors also have SIMD instructions for multimedia applications: some complex instructions do pay after all.\nOn the CISC side, all recent processors are to some extent RISC inside. They have microcode to define all these complex macro instructions. The sheer complexity of the processor makes the design of each model take several years, even with a RISC design, what with the large number of components, with pipelining and predictive execution and whatnot.\nSo why do the fastest processors remain CISC outside? Part of it, in the case of the x86 (32-bit and 64-bit) family, is historical compatibility. But that's not the whole of it. In the early 2000s, Intel tried pushing the Itanium architecture. Itanium is an extreme case of complex instructions (not really CISC, though: its design has been dubbed EPIC). It even does away with the old-fashioned idea of executing instructions in sequence: all instructions are executed in parallel until the next barrier. One of the reasons Itanium didn't take is that nobody, whether at Intel or elsewhere, could write a decent compiler for it. Now a good old mostly-sequential processor like x86_64, that's something we understand."

    "response": "I'll answer this question from the theoretical side. The exponential behavior follows simply from the Schrödinger equation. Consider the one-electron Schrödinger equation:\n$$\n(-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}))\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\epsilon\\psi(\\mathbf{r}), \\epsilon < 0\n$$\nAt spatial points that are very far away from the nucleus, $V(\\mathbf{r})\\approx 0$, so that the asymptotic solution is given by\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\epsilon\\psi(\\mathbf{r}), \\epsilon < 0\n$$\nThis differential equation has basic solutions of the form\n$$\n\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = Ce^{-\\sqrt{-2\\epsilon}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nfor some unit vector $\\mathbf{k}$. The real asymptotic behavior of $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$ is thus a linear combination of these basic solutions. The linear combination may bring a polynomial prefactor to the exponential, but will never alter the exponent. Thus we have not only proved the exponential behavior, but also derived the correct exponent $\\alpha = \\sqrt{-2\\epsilon}$. For a multi-electronic, non-interacting system, the overall decay rate is governed by the slowest decaying orbital, i.e. the HOMO.\nOf course, the real wavefunction can only be described by a multi-electron Schrödinger equation. But we can work on the equivalent Kohn-Sham system and show that the Kohn-Sham wavefunction decays at a rate given by the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy. By Janak's theorem, the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy is just the negative of the ionization potential of the exact system. To see this, consider a huge ensemble of $N$ identical, non-interacting molecules. If we remove one electron from the ensemble and let the hole delocalize evenly between all the molecules, then as $N\\to +\\infty$, the electron removal has a negligible impact on the electron density of any molecule (and therefore the Kohn-Sham potential of each molecule). Therefore under the Kohn-Sham framework we see that removing such an electron costs an energy of $-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ (it does not matter whether the HOMO refers to that of the ensemble or that of a molecule, since their orbital energies are equal), since the electron is taken from an energy level whose energy is $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ and the Hamiltonian is not changed in this process. On the other hand, from the perspective of the real system it is clear that the energy cost is equal to the first ionization energy of one of the molecules, $I$. Therefore we have $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}} = -I$, which means that the Kohn-Sham wavefunction decays like (again up to a possible polynomial prefactor; the precise determination of this polynomial prefactor is a much more difficult question)\n$$\n\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = Ce^{-\\sqrt{2I}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nAlthough the Kohn-Sham wavefunction is fictional, its density is equal to the true multielectronic density, and in order for the true density to have the same asymptotic behavior as the Kohn-Sham density, the true wavefunction must have the same asymptotic behavior as the Kohn-Sham wavefunction.

First, many experts believe that such a border wall will not work.  Second, there is real concern that the Administration, put simply, has no plan to build the border wall.  For example, the Administration has not detailed how to 1) use eminent domain and other procedures to acquire land from private landowners and Native American tribes, 2) design the wall, 3) locate the wall, 4) construct the wall, and 5) require Mexico to pay for the wall given the President’s clear and repeated promises that he would force Mexico to do so. Finally, there are objections to the construction of a wall from Democratic and Republican members of Congress that represent border states.  Given these and other concerns, we believe it would be inappropriate to insist on the inclusion of such funding in a must-pass appropriations bill that is needed for the Republican majority in control of the Congress to avert a government shutdown so early in President Trump’s Administration.\n[...]\nSenator Charles Schumer\nSenator Richard Durbin\nSenator Patty Murray\nSenator Debbie Stabenow\nSenator Patrick Leahy\n\nBased on this letter, it appears their main objections to a full border wall are currently the cost-benefit ratio and the legal issues of taking land from Americans to build it on; objections that may not be unique to Democrats."

The ```-``` for both commands specifies that a pipe will be used for output and input respectively.\nTo optimize the result without saving a file, you can pipe the output from ```convert``` to a second ```convert``` command:\n```ffmpeg -i input.flv -vf scale=320:-1 -r 10 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm - | convert -delay 10 -loop 0 - gif:- | convert -layers Optimize - output.gif\n```\nThe ```gif:-``` tells ```convert``` to pipe its output as gif formatted data and ```-layers Optimize``` tells the second ```convert``` to perform ```optimize-frame``` and ```optimize-transparancy``` methods (see the ImageMagick Introduction to Animation Optimization). Note that the output from the ```-layers Optimize``` may not always provide a smaller file size, so you may want to try converting to a gif without optimization first to be sure.\nRemember that during this whole process everything is in memory so you may need sufficient memory if the images are quite large."

The compiler inserts auto-unboxing code to the 2nd operand (return value of ```returnsNull()```) to make it type ```boolean```.  This of course causes the NPE from the ```null``` returned at run-time.\n* For E2, types of the 2nd and 3rd operands are `````` (not ```Boolean``` as in E1!) and ```boolean``` respectively, so no specific typing clause applies (go read 'em!), so the final \"otherwise\" clause applies:\n\n  Otherwise, the second and third operands are of types S1 and S2 respectively. Let T1 be the type that results from applying boxing conversion to S1, and let T2 be the type that results from applying boxing conversion to S2.

Such shenanigans are impossible for other device types in PCI, which is why PCI sound cards have so much trouble providing compatibility with programs written for ISA sound cards.\n\nThis is the reason why there’s a specific “VGA compatible controller” device type in PCI. Such shenanigans are impossible for other device types in PCI, which is why PCI sound cards have so",
    "response": "DOOM itself doesn’t do anything special to benefit from PCI graphics cards. It runs faster with PCI graphics cards (and VLB, AGP, and PCI Express cards) than with ISA graphics cards because the supporting bus is faster, so reads from and writes to video memory take less time.\nPCI goes to great lengths to preserve backwards compatibility with ISA-based VGA, providing support for “VGA compatible” adapters so that they can appear in memory at the same locations and use the same I/O ports as ISA VGA cards. So accesses to the VGA registers and to the VGA buffer (at 0xA0000) go directly to the main PCI VGA compatible adapter in the system, with no change required in the operating system or programs running on it. (This is the reason why there’s a specific “VGA compatible controller” device type in PCI. Such shenanigans are impossible for other device types in PCI, which is why PCI sound cards have so much trouble providing compatibility with programs written for ISA sound cards.)\nA faster bus and/or faster video memory immediately leads to higher performance in video-intensive programs because software doesn’t need to be careful about how it accesses video memory (except on CGA, and on all platforms with vertical blank synchronisation if it cares about tearing). So ```REP MOVSW``` or ```REP MOVSD``` with no waiting in software, once the program decides to write a frame, is perfectly fine, and will go faster and faster as the underlying hardware improves. On platforms where this can’t work in hardware (e.g. on an 8088 with a VGA card), the hardware takes care of specifics — for example on an 8088 the bus unit will split up 16-bit accesses.\nYour question is specific to DOOM but other DOS games are in a similar situation. Later games tended to rely on VBE (often using UniVBE) to access video modes beyond those provided by VGA, but they mostly didn’t use anything beyond video-mode setup and framebuffer configuration (see also Were any DOS games (or software) known to use VBE/AF?), so improved video speed came mostly from bus speed increases, faster video memory, and speed increases in the cards themselves (which was already a factor in the ISA era, compare most Trident cards to Tseng cards for example).\nFor an excellent explanation of the intricacies of VGA programming and its memory layout, see Fabien Sanglard’s Game Engine Black Book series. The DOOM update loop is shown on page 185 of the DOOM book; it doesn’t use any assembly language (unlike the renderer, see pp. 290 and following), but it does have one perhaps surprising feature given the 32-bit nature of the code: VGA updates are done 16 bits at a time. Section 2.3 of the same book, pp. 59 and following, describes some of the improvements to VGA adapters around the time DOOM was released, in particular the switch to the VESA Local Bus on 486s. The benchmark table on page 287 shows the importance of the bus."

    "response": "Trade surplus/deficit\nDevaluing one's currency means mostly one thing: It becomes more expensive to import products from abroad, while one's own products become comparably cheaper to buy on the world market. That means a country which exports lots of goods wants to devalue their currency while a country which imports lots of goods does not.\nIn 2016, Turkey imported goods worth US $186 billion and exported goods worth US $156 billion. That means they had a trade deficit of 19%.\nHowever, China only imported goods worth US $1.23 trillion and exported goods worth US $2.27 trillion in 2016. That means they had a trade surplus of 84%.\nWhich is why China wants to devalue their currency while Turkey does not.\nDebt management\nAnother reason to devalue one's currency is that it reduces any debts denoted in that currency. If a country has a problem of too much public and private debt, then an easy way to get rid of it is to cause a hyperinflation. \nChina happens to have a debt-to-gdp ratio of 47.6% while Turkey only has one of 28.3%. When you look at the private debt (debt of private citizens and companies in the country), you see the same picture. Private debit in Turkey was 170% of GDP, while China's is rumored to be over 300%.\nWhich is why reducing debt through causing inflation seems more attractive to China than to Turkey.\nForeign investor relations\nSo why don't all countries get rid of their debt by adding a few zeroes to their bank notes? Because inflating your currency is a surefire way to drive away any foreign investors. Nobody will invest money into your country when that money might be worth nothing in a few years. Investors want stable currencies. Again, we observe the same difference in motivation between Turkey and China here. Turkey is actively inviting foreign investors, but China is quite reluctant to allow foreign economic influence in their country."

They may therefore be dissuaded from infringing simply by the existence of a patent and the assumption that you would sue. Such a chilling effect on competition may be valuable to you.\nIn addition, if there is infringement, you may be able to get a licensing agreement without the need for litigation. This can be a very lucrative business model, and so may justify the cost of patenting.\nAnd if litigation seems likely, there is a nascent field of litigation funding. While your funders will take quite a great deal of the damages, you may at least get something out of the end of it.\nFinally, even if you can't sue, someone else could.

    "generated_instruction": "How does casting in Java impact performance?\n\nResponse: Explain how casting in Java impacts performance\n\n\n\n> In Java, casting is used to convert between types. This is an important concept, since casting is used in many different situations where we need to convert between types.\n\nOne common type of casting is casting between reference types and primitive types. For example, we might use the following code:\n```\nint i = 10;\nString s = (String) i; // cast to String\nint j = (int) s;\n```\nThis cast converts the int value 10 from the int type to the String type. The cast is safe because the type of the s variable is a String, and the cast is only performed if the type of s is also a String.\n\nAnother common type of casting is casting between reference types and classes. For example, we might use the following code:\n```\nString s = \"Hello\";\nObject o = s;\nString t = (String) o; // cast to String\nint i = t.length();\n```\nThis cast converts the String reference s from the String class to the int type. The cast is safe because the type of the o variable is Object, and the cast is only performed if the type of s is also a String.",
    "response": "There are 2 types of casting in Java:\n\nImplicit casting, when you cast from a type to a wider type, which is done automatically and there is no overhead:\n```String s = \"Cast\";\nObject o = s; // implicit casting\n```\nExplicit casting, when you go from a wider type to a more narrow one. For this case, you must explicitly use casting like that:\n```Object o = someObject;\nString s = (String) o; // explicit casting\n```\nIn this second case, there is overhead in runtime, because the two types must be checked and in case that casting is not feasible, JVM must throw a ClassCastException.\n\nTaken from JavaWorld: The cost of casting\n\n> Casting is used to convert between types -- between reference types in particular, for the type of casting operation in which we're interested here.  Upcast operations (also called widening conversions in the Java Language Specification) convert a subclass reference to an ancestor class reference. This casting operation is normally automatic, since it's always safe and can be implemented directly by the compiler. Downcast operations (also called narrowing conversions in the Java Language Specification) convert an ancestor class reference to a subclass reference. This casting operation creates execution overhead, since Java requires that the cast be checked at runtime to make sure that it's valid. If the referenced object is not an instance of either the target type for the cast or a subclass of that type, the attempted cast is not permitted and must throw a java.lang.ClassCastException.\n"

    "response": "There are a few fundamental considerations:\n\n* Uncertainty is a part of the game. The referee and linesmen are the arbiters of the action. Instant replay would limit their authority.\n* Football is global. Many places do not have access to the technology necessary to implement instant replay.\n* Football is a fast-paced game with few opportunities for stoppage. Instant replay would unnecessarily slow the pace.\n\nIn 2008, FiFA President Sepp Blatter said:\n\n  \"Let it be as it is and let's leave [football] with errors. The television companies will have the right to say [the referee] was right or wrong, but still the referee makes the decision – a man, not a machine.\"\n\nBlatter and others at FIFA have repeatedly argued against using instant replay. But lately, FIFA has begun to come around on the idea. At FIFA's Congress in São Paulo prior to the 2014 World Cup, Blatter proposed allowing managers 2 challenges per game, much like the NFL handles challenges today.\nAlthough it's not quite \"instant replay,\" in 2012 FIFA approved two different goal-line technologies to improve referee accuracy: \"Hawk-Eye\" -- which uses visual triangulation to determine ball location -- and \"GoalRef\" -- which uses a microchip in the ball and magnetic sensors within goalposts. (Many say FIFA approved the technologies in response to Frank Lampard's snubbed \"goal\" against Germany in the 2010 World Cup.) In 2013, FIFA announced it would use GoalControl, a German competitor to Hawk-Eye, at the Confederations Cup, basically a rehearsal for the World Cup. After a successful run at that tournament, FIFA announced it would implement GoalControl at the 2014 World Cup. The Guardian provides a pretty helpful FAQ on the technology.\nFIFA may choose to implement further changes to approved goal-line technology and referee rules when it meets again after the World Cup."

In particular, network encryption like Wifi encryption are primarily designed to protect from a local attacker from being able to watch network patterns (by recording who you're making connections with, and discovering what devices are on the local network), observing/tampering of low level messages like ARP/DNS, and protecting network broadcasts from devices that aren't supposed to be in the network, and from tampering or selective interference. Application encryption, on the other hand, is designed to protect the low level TCP/IP packets, which leaks information like the IP address of the machine you're connecting with, and the TLS handshake also by design leaks a number of information about the connection like Server Name Indication (SNI) header.

Yes, your oven was probably set way higher, but the water content in your filling prevents it from getting hotter than boiling water. Commercial canning is done in the vicinity of 120-130°C, which is possible because the cans are cooked under pressure. So unlike in a can, most pathogens were destroyed, but not necessarily all of them. For human consumption, that’s perfectly fine as long as the remaining ones don’t get the time-temperature combo to regrow.\nSecond, a bread dough may be dense (although the aim is usually something different), but by no means airtight. Interestingly, wrapping meat in dense dough was used as preservation method in medieval times - the “ancestor” of today’s pork pies and pastries. But while the hard flour crust (not intended to be eaten originally) did form a protective layer and usually extended the shelf life more or less, it was by no means food safe judged by modern standards - although some pies were stored for months. But your fluffy buns are truly not a protective layer. Which means you should refrigerate your buns, but also that you get to enjoy the whole dish."

Phylogenetic systematics, which has completely replaced the Linnean system, views all organisms as interrelated in a nested set of monophyletic groups (clades).

All dinosaurs are reptiles. Therefore, birds are dinosaurs and reptiles. They are just more closely related to dinosaurs than to other reptiles.\nThe tricky part is that most people have an intuitive idea of what \"reptiles\" and \"dinosaurs\" are. To a systematist, whose job it is to classify organisms, these terms don't mean the same thing as they do to most people. Systematists think about groups like Reptilia and Dinosauria and how those groups are related to one another. So they have no problem saying that birds are dinosaurs and reptiles, because birds are nested within both of those groups.\n\nA few words about pterosaurs\nAlong with birds and bats, pterosaurs are the other clade of vertebrates capable of powered, flapping flight. Pterosaurs fall within Reptilia (and Diapsida and Archosauria) along with Dinosauria, which includes birds. There are a lot of other extinct lineages in the tree that are not shown, e.g., ornithodirans that are not dinosaurs and not pterosaurs. Pterosaurs and birds share anatomical features that all reptiles, diapsids, archosaurs, and ornithodirans have, which is how we know that they are more closely related to each other than to other groups, like crocodiles. But their flight structures evolved independently and are anatomically distinct fro one another. So pterosaurs are flying reptiles but not flying dinosaurs.\nThese images might help you understand the above explanation."

You need to be able to search for cars by their type and also to know if a car belongs to a certain type. \n\nIn the ER model you have a table called cars, where you have a column called car_type, which groups together all the cars of a single type. If you have a table called car_subtype, which groups together all the cars of a particular subtype, you can join the car_subtype table to the car table.\n\nIn the relational model you can also do this, but you need to use the JOIN statement. If you have a table called car_subtype, you can join the car_subtype table to the car table.\n\nThe problem is that you don't want to put the column car_type in the JOIN statement because the JOIN statement has to be optimized to get the best performance, and putting the column car_type in the JOIN statement will make the optimization harder.\n\nThe solution is to embed the column car_type in the cars table, and in the car_subtype table. \n\nThe subclasses are an instance of the superclass, so the subclasses extend the superclass.\n\nResponse: Can you explain the problem and how it can be solved in the two models?\n\nResponse: The generalization/specialization problem is that you need to know which type of car it is, whether it is a gas car, electric car or hybrid car.

    "response": "The different types of cars are an instance of a general problem that surfaces over and over again in data modeling.  It is called \"generalization/specialization\" in ER modeling, and \"superclass/subclass\" in object modeling.  \nAn object modeler uses the inheritance features built into the object model to solve the problem quite easily.  The subclasses simply extend the superclass.\nThe relational modeler is faced with a problem.  how to design the tables so as to emulate the benefits that one would get from inheritance?  \nThe simplest technique is called single table inheritance.  Data about all types of cars are grouped into a single table for cars.  There is a column, car_type, that groups together all the cars of a single type.  No car can belong to more than one type.  If a column is irrelevant to, say, electric cars,  it will be left NULL in the rows that pertain to electric cars.\nThis simple solution works well for the smaller and simpler cases.  The presence of a lot of NULLs adds a tiny bit to storage overhead, and a little bit to retrieval overhead.  The developer may have to learn SQL three-valued logic if boolean tests are done on nullable columns.  This can be baffling at first, but one gets used to it.\nThere is another technique, called class table inheritance.  In this design, there are separate tables for gas_car, electric_car, and hybrid_car, in addition to a combined table, car, for all of them.  When you want all of the data about a specific kind of car, you join the car table with the appropriate specialized table.  There are fewer NULLs in this design, but you do more joining.  This technique works better in the larger and more complex cases.\nThere is a third technique called shared primary key.  This technique is often used in conjunction with class table inheritance.  The specialized tables for the subclasses have, as their primary key, a copy of the primary key of the corresponding entry in the car table.  This id column can  be declared to be both the primary key and a foreign key.\nThis involves a little extra programming when new cars are to be added, but it makes the joins simple, easy, and fast.\nSuperclasses and subclasses happen all the time in the real world.  Don't be afraid.  But do test your initial design for performance. If your first attempt is simple and sound, you'll be able to tweak it to speed it up."

The first half of the linked document contains the Court's majority opinion and the concurring opinion of Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, followed by the separate dissenting opinions of Justices Thomas and Alito.\nBased on a quick read, it's apparent that Justice Thomas agrees with the general court's opinion that a sitting President &quot;is not entitled to absolute immunity from issuance of [a] subpoena&quot;. Thomas dissents on the grounds that the President &quot;may be entitled to relief against [a subpoena's] enforcement&quot; based on his special status as president. Thomas argues (agreeing with the president) that the case should be vacated and returned to the lower court, so that the President can argue that his duties to the nation take up all of his time and attention and he thus deserves relief from the subpoena.\nJustice Alito makes a stronger dissent. While he agrees that a sitting President is not absolutely immune from a state subpoena, he argues that such a subpoena should not be enforced unless it meets a stringent legal test, such that:\n\n* It does not interfere with the President's execution of his duties of office, and\n* It carries a weight of urgency — e.g., subpoenaing information related to suspected treason — as a guarantee it is not merely issued to harass.\n\nIn the absence of those conditions, in Alito's opinion, the President is only subject to the constitutional process of impeachment and trial in Congress.\nSo no, neither dissenting Justice suggests that the President is absolutely immune from this kind of subpoena. Instead, they are concerned that the issuance of such subpoenas might negatively impact on the President's ability to perform the duties of the office, and argue that the President might legitimately be granted varying degrees of relief from such legal actions at a court's discretion."

Later printings changed this to &quot;halfling&quot;. This change occurred between the fifth printing (Dec 1975 - Apr 1976) and sixth printing (1977), with the six printing being marked the Original Collector's Edition.\n\nResponse: Explain the name change from &quot;",
    "response": "Halflings were originally called hobbits prior to a legal challenge.\nAccording to Gary Gygax himself, it was due to a legal claim on &quot;hobbit&quot; by a company who purchased the merchandising rights on Tolkien's works in 1976:\n\nTSR was served with papers threatening damages to the tune of half a mil by the Saul Zantes (sp?) division of Elan Merchandising on behalf of the tolkien Estate. The main objection was to the boardgame we were publishing, The Battle of Five Armies. The author of that game had given us a letter from his attorney claiming the work was grandfathered because it was published after the copyrights for JRRT's works had lapsed and before any renewals were made. The action also demanded we remove balrog, dragon, dwarf, elf, ent, goblin, hobbit, orc, and warg from the D&D game. Although only balrog and warg were unique names we agreed to hobbit as well, kept the rest, of course. The boardgame was dumped, and thus the suit was settled out of court at that.\n\nHalflings were originally called &quot;hobbits&quot; in the Dungeons & Dragons box set first released in 1974. Later printings changed this to &quot;halfling&quot;.\nAccording to The Acaeum, this change occurred between the fifth printing (Dec 1975 - Apr 1976) and sixth printing (1977), with the six printing being marked the Original Collector's Edition. However, Tim Kask has said that box sets were generally thrown together with whichever printings of the books were on hand, so the distinctions between printings are inexact. The Acaeum notes at least one box set shipped having the revised booklets but no Original Collector's Edition mark.\nDue to an oversight, a single reference to &quot;hobbit&quot; remained on page 6 of Men & Magic, which was fixed in the 2013 Deluxe reprint and PDF copies.\nAccording to Wikipedia, J.R.R. Tolkien sold the film, stage, and merchandising rights to The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings to United Artists in 1968, who sold them in turn to Saul Zaentz in 1976. Zaents would go on to produce the 1978 Lord of the Rings animated movie."

    "response": "The command line procedure is not simple, but it is the most likely thing to work. \nWhen re-formatting the \"drive\" you're actually only formatting a partition on the drive. You need to use the diskpart utility to remove the partitions and create 1 single partition covering the full volume.\n```diskpart``` can be a bit dangerous, because if you pick the wrong disk or partition, you can remove data or partitions that are extremely, EXTREMELY important and lose all data on your machine. \nProceed with extreme caution!\nOpen up a command prompt as administrator (open the start menu, type ```cmd``` and press Enter.)\nType ```diskpart``` and press Enter. You'll end up with a new prompt that looks like this:\n```DISKPART>\n```\nType\n```list disk \n```\nand you'll get a listing of all drives on your machine. \nType\n```select disk # \n```\nto select a disk, where ```#``` is the number of the disk Windows screw-balled. Usually, the device is disk 1, but it's always best to make sure.\nThen type\n```list partition \n```\nto get a listing of all partitions on the disk.\nIf you're sure you have the right disk/partition, you can then repeat typing\n```select partition # \ndelete partition \n```\nuntil all partitions are removed from that drive (you may need to type ```delete partition override``` for protected partitions).\nOnce the drive is empty, exit diskpart and remove the drive. Wait at least 5 minutes, then re-insert the drive. DO NOT CLICK FORMAT – this will most likely re-create the problem. Instead, enter diskpart again, and select the disk. Then type\n```create partition primary \n```\nOnce you have created the partition, exit ```diskpart``` and, in the command promt, type \n```diskmgmt.msc \n```\nThis will provide a reliable way to create a FAT32 partition. On the drive you would like to format (NEVER TOUCH DISK 0!), right click and select ```format```. The ```allocation unit size``` option should be default, and the ```File System``` option should be set to ```FAT32```. The format may take a while, depending on the disk size, be patient.\nThis should fix partition troubles on any readable USB flash drive."

    "original_instruction": "This guy claims that Olympic powerlifters working in the 1-6 rep range can increase strength without increasing muscle size. \n\n> Trained Olympic lifters, for example, were shown over a two-year period to have significant strength increases with barely noticeable increases in muscle mass (Hakkinen et al, 1988). I had a similar experience when I used AST's Max-OT principals. My strength went up like crazy, but I gained very little size. Obviously, traditional strength training with low volume and low sets (1-6 reps, 3 or less sets) is not the best approach. Strength training does cause hypertrophy (Hakkinen et al, 1985), but it won't cause maximum hypertrophy.\n\nWhat is the scientific explanation for this? Is the inverse true?

    "response": "Certainly there is a correlation between muscle mass and strength, but there is more to the story. Two reasons why muscle mass and strength may not be completely congruous are:\n\n* Muscle fiber density\n* Muscle utilization\n\nDensity:\nYour muscles are composed of four different types of fibers (slow-twitch, and three forms of fast-twitch). These fibers have different profiles in terms of force applied and recovery time. Slow twitch fibers, for example, recover quickly but have less force as there are fewer muscle fibers per bundle, compared with the fast-twitch fibers. \nExtra water in the form of glycogen can also cause muscles to take up more volume with the same amount of actual muscle. This glycogen can be a ready source of energy for the muscles, but isn't going to increase their maximum theoretical force for a single heavy lift (per Olympic competition) where endurance through a long set isn't at issue.\nUtilization:\nThe average person is able to utilize 20-30% of their total theoretical muscle strength when trying their hardest. (Ref. Tsatsouline, Power To The People) Top lifters use perhaps 50% of their theoretical strength. Olympic and powerlifting-style training focuses on training the neural pathways to utilize a greater percentage of the available muscle mass. Since muscle fibers contract all internal cells (the all-or-nothing principal), this training is focused on convincing a greater proportion of fiber bundles to contract during a lift. \n\nCan a buff guy be weak? \nWell, it depends on your definition of buff. A cut guy can be weak (compared to a strength athlete), because muscle definition is more about having low body fat covering the muscle than it is about having large muscles. \nA bodybuilder with decent volume won't be able to lift as much as a comparable powerlifter because he/she doesn't train for strength per se.

Some offsetting schemes planted  thousands of trees of the same species, resulting in a large monoculture. Such a monoculture hinders biodiversity, is susceptible to diseases and can even damage local communities.\nThere have also been reports that planting trees above a certain latitude can have a net warming effect by changing the albedo and trapping heat. \n\n* Buying offsets reduces the incentive for people to reduce their emissions.\nReducing emissions is much more effective than offsetting. Buying carbon offsets can lead to people thinking they are doing the right thing, whereas they had better spent their time and effort in reducing their emissions. Of course this point goes for all offsetting-schemes and is not specifically for planting trees.\n\n* There are more effective ways of reducing carbon emissions than planting trees.\nNowadays many offsetting schemes invest in development of renewable energy sources (in developing countries) instead of planting trees, simply because it is a more effective and cheaper way to reduce emissions."

    "response": "A standard method is to generate three standard normals and construct a unit vector from them. That is, when $X_i \\sim N(0,1)$ and $\\lambda^2 = X_1^2 + X_2^2 + X_3^2$, then $(X_1/\\lambda, X_2/\\lambda, X_3/\\lambda)$ is uniformly distributed on the sphere.  This method works well for $d$-dimensional spheres, too.\nIn 3D you can use rejection sampling: draw $X_i$ from a uniform$[-1,1]$ distribution until the length of $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$ is less than or equal to 1, then--just as with the preceding method--normalize the vector to unit length.  The expected number of trials per spherical point equals $2^3/(4 \\pi / 3)$ = 1.91.  In higher dimensions the expected number of trials gets so large this rapidly becomes impracticable.\nThere are many ways to check uniformity.  A neat way, although somewhat computationally intensive, is with Ripley's K function.  The expected number of points within (3D Euclidean) distance $\\rho$ of any location on the sphere is proportional to the area of the sphere within distance $\\rho$, which equals $\\pi\\rho^2$.  By computing all interpoint distances you can compare the data to this ideal.\nGeneral principles of constructing statistical graphics suggest a good way to make the comparison is to plot variance-stabilized residuals $e_i(d_{[i]} - e_i)$ against $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n(n-1)/2=m$ where $d_{[i]}$ is the $i^\\text{th}$ smallest of the mutual distances and $e_i = 2\\sqrt{i/m}$.  The plot should be close to zero. "

Examples would include vendors, quest givers, or enemies. In some games, (particularly RPG's), the term is also used to refer to characters under the control of, but not generated by the player. They are often distinguished by having distinct personalities and dialog, whereas a \"\"Player Character\"\" is meant as more of an extension of the player themselves. Think of the companion party members in the Mass Effect series for an example.\n\nA Bot, by contrast, is essentially a player of the game controlled by a computer. This can be populated within a single instance, as a feature in some games (i.e. AI opponents in a normally multiplayer game), or, in some cases, actually represents a separate instance of the application running on a networked computer and being controlled by some manner of AI script (as is common in many MMO's, much to the dismay of the communities playing the game). The term 'Bot' is also often used to refer to software used to enhance or replace the skills of a human player of the game; for example, an 'Aim-Bot' that handles targeting, or a 'Farming Bot' in an MMO that performs tedious or menial tasks. Such bots are usually (though not always), considered cheating and a violation of the Terms of Service of the game in question."

    "response": "Java has static nested classes but it sounds like you're looking for a top-level static class. Java has no way of making a top-level class static but you can simulate a static class like this:\n\n* Declare your class ```final``` - Prevents extension of the class since extending a static class makes no sense\n* Make the constructor ```private``` - Prevents instantiation by client code as it makes no sense to instantiate a static class\n* Make all the members and functions of the class ```static``` -  Since the class cannot be instantiated no instance methods can be called or instance fields accessed\n* Note that the compiler will not prevent you from declaring an instance (non-static) member. The issue will only show up if you attempt to call the instance member\n\nSimple example per suggestions from above:\n```public class TestMyStaticClass {\n     public static void main(String []args){\n        MyStaticClass.setMyStaticMember(5);\n        System.out.println(\"Static value: \" + MyStaticClass.getMyStaticMember());\n        System.out.println(\"Value squared: \" + MyStaticClass.squareMyStaticMember());\n        // MyStaticClass x = new MyStaticClass(); // results in compile time error\n     }\n}\n// A top-level Java class mimicking static class behavior\npublic final class MyStaticClass {\n    private MyStaticClass () { // private constructor\n        myStaticMember = 1;\n    }\n    private static int myStaticMember;\n    public static void setMyStaticMember(int val) {\n        myStaticMember = val;\n    }\n    public static int getMyStaticMember() {\n        return myStaticMember;\n    }\n    public static int squareMyStaticMember() {\n        return myStaticMember * myStaticMember;\n    }\n}\n```\nWhat good are static classes? A good use of a static class is in defining one-off, utility and/or library classes where instantiation would not make sense. A great example is the Math class that contains some mathematical constants such as PI and E and simply provides mathematical calculations. Requiring instantiation in such a case would be unnecessary and confusing. See the ```Math``` class and source code. Notice that it is ```final``` and all of its members are ```static```. If Java allowed top-level classes to be declared ```static``` then the Math class would indeed be static."

It was, in fact, one of the very first things people could find out about the Star Wars universe.\nThe point of the films wasn't to conceal the fact Palpatine would end up the Emperor (or was Darth Sidious), it was to show that he was a masterful chessmaster who conned everyone, and that in large part it was the good guys responsible for his rise because of their own blindness. Amidala initiated the vote that removed his predecessor. Jar-Jar initiated the vote that gave him emergency powers. The Jedi Council allowed him to operate under their noses. Anakin never suspected he was being manipulated until too late, and so on.

Others have done it, e.g. Brian Dickerson: The perils of repeating political nonsense and came to the conclusion that the claim was wrong.\n\nYou just need the chance a random person from a large group has a genius level IQ, then multiply it with the number of people in China and compare the result with the number of people in the USA. The IQ follows a Gaussian distribution where 100 is the mean by definition and a standard deviation (SD) of 15 (after Wechsler) or 16 (after Stanford-Binet). The rarity of a particular IQ can be calculated easily and are listed by the IQ Comparison Site. These numbers give the percentage of people with an IQ equal or lower than the given IQ and the rarity of this occurring.\n\nThe main question actually is what an genius level IQ is. There is no definite answer. According to the IQ Comparison Site, it is 140 or higher (\"Genius or near genius\") while another source states it as at least 160.\nThe rarity of such an IQ is 1/261 (with a SD of 15) or 1/161 (SD=16) for an IQ of 140 and 1/31,560 (SD=15) or 1/11,307 (SD=16) for an IQ of 160 according to Wikipedia. \n\nThe population of USA for 2012 is about 313,221,000 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The population of China for 2011 is about 1,370,537,000.\nTaking the lowest rarity of 1/161 from above then there are about 1,370,537,000/161 =  about 8,513,000 geniuses in China, which is significantly less then the 313,221,000 Americans.\nIf you take the 15 SD value of 1/261 then you get only about 5,251,000 Chinese geniuses.\nWith the 160 IQ points, which are more realistic to indicate a real genius, the numbers are even smaller (about 43,400 or 12,100). Note that 1,370,537,000/313,221,000 = 4.375, so in order for this claim to be true actually one of every four (or say five) Chinese would need to be a Genius. Even without the numbers above, it can be easily understood that this is not the case.\nConclusion: This claim is wrong according to the definition and probabilities of the IQ.\n\nSupplement:\nIt has been pointed out, that there are published research results showing that China and other Asian countries have a higher average IQ of about 106 (or even as high as 115) as the normed average of 100. This would increase the number of geniuses in China: The above factor of 1/161 would drop to about 1/60 or, for a Chinese average of 115, even to about 1/17. These numbers can be easily calculated using the standard deviation, e.g. using MS Excel's function ```NORM.DIST(140, 106, 16, TRUE)```. However, both these factors are not in any way close to the US/Chinese population ratio of about 1/4.375, so the original conclusion still holds."

    "response": "The peak power at work when a flash is being discharged is extreme.\nExample: a classic Metz 45CT (a large but still handheld unit) on full manual power delivers around 90 watt-seconds of electrical output to the flash tube in 1/300s. That means there are 27000 watts at work for a short time.\nA 27000 watt lightbulb (BTW, your flash is much brighter than that - more efficient!) would need the ampacity of around eight european household sockets (230V, fused at 13 or 16 amps) to operate, since it would draw around 120 ampere from them. At the voltage levels xenon flash tubes typically operate at, around 80 amperes will flow; if you wanted to pull that energy \"live\" from a 5-6V battery, you'd need to pull around 5000 amperes AND instantaneously convert them to around 80 amperes at high voltage. Batteries that could deliver 5000 amps - while not wasting most of the power as heat generated across their internal resistance - for a short duration and live certainly exist - you are looking at starter batteries for big lorries, which are rather inconvenient to lug around. Also, a 5000 ampere current pulse is quite a magnetic nuisance if there is anything either ferromagnetic or intended as an electrical conductor near the conductors used.\nYour average \"big\" speedlite, btw, will be around half the power described here (but might in some cases reach the same or higher peak currents in order to discharge even faster), an in-camera flash will be a fraction of these numbers - but still inconvenient to build any other way.\nIf you need a short, massive current pulse, the best energy source available in engineering is a previously charged capacitor (metal-paper or electrolytic type, not dual-layer \"supercap\"). This energy storage device is large for its storage capacity if you compare it to a battery - but able to respond far quicker to high current demand, since a) there is no chemical energy conversion involved in its operation, b) the relevant current path only involves metallic, very conductive parts instead of ionic conductors (aka electrolytes. An electrolytic capacitor, btw, does use its electrolyte for chemical self-upkeep, not for chemical energy storage or electrical connectivity). \nAlso, since the charge in a a capacitor is limited, it allows portioning total energy to what the flashlamp can safely take. This allows a flash in manual mode to just completely discharge the capacitor until it is nearly empty (when the remaining charge can only deliver voltage below the quench voltage of the flashlamp) without complex control circuitry - and at the same time gives you a safety fallback when working with dynamically controlled power levels (telecomputer or TTL mode), leaving no way for catastrophic circuit failure in combination with several kilowatts of constant power available turning into a massive safety hazard. A handheld-sized efficient electrical near point light source with 27000W input, driven constantly, would first severely damage your eyes and then self destroy violently (think of a welding arc - dangerously bright, and it melts metal)."

I'm sorry you're experiencing this.\nHere are some things to consider that may help you and your colleagues cope with the added stress and emotions following a layoff:\n\n* Acknowledge the layoff and the feelings of your colleagues. Avoiding the topic can extend negative feelings and disenfranchise those most impacted. You should find an opportunity to connect with your colleagues for an honest conversation about your feelings following the layoff.  Perhaps reach out to hold a number of 1-on-1 conversations, or gather your team for an off-site lunch and prompt the discussion.\n* Acknowledge that everyone will be impacted differently. Some of your colleagues will feel totally okay and ready to get back to work.  Others will feel anxious and worried in a way that prevents them from performing the same way they did before the layoff.  There is no right or \"professional\" reaction to a layoff.  Be open to the feelings and reactions of all of your colleagues equally.\n* Create practical solutions to new processes and responsibilities. If your team now has a greater workload, be a generator of solutions.  Try out ideas for making processes in your team more efficient and predictable.\n* Create transparency about the state of the business and potential future staff changes. Layoffs are a clear indication of business trouble.  Facilitate sharing facts about the state of the business and actively work to eliminate rumors.  Additionally, layoffs will likely cause shifts in responsibility as roles are consolidated or reorganized.  Make clear who has specific responsibilities both inside and outside of your team.  Actively eliminate any sources of uncertainty and anxiety that you can.\n* Be a role model. Don't participate in gossip or complaining about the layoff.  Don't disparage management or other colleagues in casual conversation.  Be a model for professionalism and caring.\n* Maintain work standards and a caring meritocracy. A layoff isn't an excuse for allowing work quality to decline.  Additionally, differences in productivity and quality between team members should be consistently and fairly addressed.  If a team member is underperforming following the layoff, provide direct feedback and ask what you can do to help.\n"

As for the correlation, it describes the similarities between to signals. But how does convolution and correlation effect on a image and how different are they in terms of effects?\nThanks",
    "generated_instruction": "How does convolution work, and why is it useful?\n\nResponse: Explain why convolution is useful, and how it works.",
    "response": "Convolution is correlation with the filter rotated 180 degrees. This makes no difference, if the filter is symmetric, like a Gaussian, or a Laplacian.  But it makes a whole lot of difference, when the filter is not symmetric, like a derivative.  \nThe reason we need convolution is that it is associative, while correlation, in general, is not. To see why this is true, remember that convolution is multiplication in the frequency domain, which is obviously associative. On the other hand, correlation in the frequency domain is multiplication by the complex conjugate, which is not associative.\nThe associativity of convolution is what allows you to \"pre-convolve\" the filters, so that you only need to convolve the image with a single filter. For example, let's say you have an image $f$, which you need to convolve with $g$ and then with $h$.  $f * g * h = f * (g * h)$. That means you can convolve $g$ and $h$ first into a single filter, and then convolve $f$ with it. This is useful, if you need to convolve many images with $g$ and $h$. You can pre-compute $k = g * h$, and then reuse $k$ multple times.\nSo if you are doing template matching, i. e. looking for a single template, correlation is sufficient. But if you need to use multiple filters in succession, and you need to perform this operation on multiple images, it makes sense to convolve the multiple filters into a single filter ahead of time."

    "response": "Put as simply as possible, horns are tubes. Blowing in special ways makes certain notes sound from those tubes. By changing one's embouchure, those notes start at a fundamental, then gradually go up in harmonics. The first notes (in key C) would be C, G, C, E, G.Those notes are the ones we hear when a bugle is played - Reveille, Last Post, etc. Bugles only play the harmonic series of notes, and can't play the ones in between. Read on.\nOn a trumpet, for starters, there are three valves. One drops any open note played by one semitone, another by two semitones, and the other by three semitones. So using a combination of valves, you can lower any open note by up to six semitones.\nLet's take the first G note. To get F♯, press the semitone valve. To get F, press the tone valve. To get E, press two valves to drop a tone and a half. (there's one valve alone that can do this). To play E♭, press the two valves that drop two tones. To get D, press the two valves to drop two and a half tones. And to get C♯, press all three.\nThat's the more complicated bit, as between the open notes, there's more semitones than anywhere else further up in pitch. Notice that between G and the next C, there are only two tones.\nSo at this point, not so many notes are needed, so the valve pressing is more simple. Next, between that C and the E, there's even fewer, so again, not so many valve changes are needed.\nNow, onto trombone. There are actually valve trombones, which work the same as trumpets, etc., but for the standard trombone, imagine those extra lengths of tube brought into play by pressing valves are now a single continuum of tubing, operated by the slide. At various places along that slide, there are all the notes found similarly to pressing valves. There's also loads of extra notes that are going to be out of tune!"

What is the rationale for this policy?  Is it something that the institution has agreed to, or is it something that has been imposed on them by the travel agent?  Are they trying to save money, or are they trying to make it easier for employees to book tickets?  What are the specific reasons for the policy, and how does it fit into the larger picture of your institution's policies?\n\n\nA: The policy you describe is a classic example of a \"travel agent contract.\"  The travel agent (here, the travel agency) makes a profit by charging a commission on the price of the ticket.  If the travel agent's commission is lower than the price the institution pays to the airline, the institution pays the difference.\n\nThere are several reasons why the institution might have this policy:\n\n* They want to keep the price of the ticket as low as possible.

The airline agrees to sell airline tickets to travelers, and the travel agency agrees to sell those tickets to the airline's customers. The airline then charges the travel agency a commission for every ticket sold. The travel agency then charges the airline a fee for each ticket sold, which the airline pays to the travel agency.\n\nThe policy you describe is a \"travel agent contract\".

    "response": "There are several reasons why such internal policies exist:\n\n* Your institution may get a discount on certain services of the travel agent if it buys enough from the agent\n* By having a contract with a reasonably-priced travel agent, they make sure that no employee books the flight with a very pricey agent or with a travel agent that happens to be a relative of the traveller\n* The travel agency offers easy methods to verify expense information and thus may lower the workload of your local administrative personnel. This especially holds if the payment is routed directly from the institution to the travel agent, which also makes sure that the flyer does not get credit card bonus points for the booking.\n* Your institution may have an agreement with the travel agent that they manually check if members of your institution are not unnecessarily booking expensive booking classes (in order to get more airline bonus miles)\n* Some insurances that your institution bought may only work if the ticket is bought directly from the institution and not by the flyer, and they elected the agent to handle such bookings.\n\nWhich of these reasons is the one why this policy exists can only be answered by the responsible employees of your institution."

For an implicit backdoor, see the Dual EC DRBG as a famous example: it worked only as long as nobody was aware that it was backdoored.\n* The backdoor's security may be quantifiable, or not. In the case of Dual EC DRBG, the mechanism uses well-trodden mathematical paths: the NSA knew that exploiting the backdoor required knowledge of an internal secret key, based on discrete logarithm (on elliptic curves).\nA non-quantifiable security is what happens when you try to push, for instance, a voluntarily flawed algorithm, or one for which you know of a cryptanalytic method that you did not publish. This is a very dangerous game for a spy agency, because you cannot really know whether third parties could find the flaw or not. Such backdooring tends to backfire in the long term.\nInterestingly, the NSA tends not to use non-quantifiable backdoors. A good example is DES. At the time it was designed, the NSA believed that it could tackle an upfront 256 exhaustive search, and that nobody else (in particular the Soviets) had the technology and budget for that. The NSA also knew of a novel cryptanalytic method (differential cryptanalysis). So when the NSA intervened in the design of DES, it insisted on shortening the key from 64 to 56 bits (that's addition of a quantifiable backdoor, and it was rather obvious, so quasi-explicit), and also on strengthening the design against differential cryptanalysis. This is a good example about how NSA consciously refrained from a non-quantifiable backdoor. There is only one thing that spy agencies fear more than not being able to spy: it is the idea that other competing spy agencies may also spy.\n\nSo a real, good backdoor is one that uses maths to offer quantifiable security against unauthorized usage of the backdoor. It is extremely difficult to have quantifiable security without making the backdoor explicit. The \"best in class\" in that area is Dual EC DRBG, and even before the Snowden business, cryptographers were already finding it weird and strongly suspected foul play (see the analyses back in 2007, 6 years before Snowden)."

The built-in ```echo``` provided by the shell is portable and can be used as expected.\n\nTo answer the question, you need to understand the difference between the built-in and the shell builtin. The built-in ```/bin/echo``` is a shell builtin, while the built-in ```echo``` provided by the shell is not. This difference arises because the shell builtin has a more flexible implementation, which allows it to work with more options and treat backslashes differently than the built-in ```echo``` provided by the shell.\n\nThis difference is important when using shell builtins, as you need to be aware of the differences to ensure that you are using the correct builtin. For example, if you are using the builtin ```echo``` in a shell script, you need to ensure that you are using the ```/bin/echo``` version, rather than the built-in shell version. Similarly, if you are using the builtin ```/bin/echo``` in a program that is called by other programs, you need to ensure that you are using the ```/bin/echo``` version, rather than the built-in shell version.\n\nTo make the most of your shell, you should try to understand the differences between built-in shell commands and the built-in shell commands. This can help you avoid mistakes and ensure that you are using the correct commands in",
    "response": "If you open up a ```bash``` prompt and type in an ```echo``` command, that uses a shell builtin rather than running ```/bin/echo```. The reasons it is still important for ```/bin/echo``` to exist are:\n\n* You're not always using a shell. Under a variety of circumstances, you run an executable directly and not through a shell.\n* At least in theory, some shells don't have an ```echo``` builtin.  This is not actually required.\n\nTo expand on #1, suppose you wanted to move all the regular files whose names started with ```abc``` anywhere in ```src``` to ```dest```. There are several ways to do that but one of them is:\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec mv -nv {} dest/ \\;\n```\nBut suppose, rather than just running that, you want to see every command that will be run first. Well, then you can prepend ```echo``` to the command, just as you might in other contexts:\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec echo mv -nv {} dest/ \\;\n```\nBut ```find``` doesn't use a shell. That runs ```/bin/echo```.\nBesides ```find``` with ```-exec``` or ```-execdir```, the ```/bin/echo``` executable will be called by other programs that themselves run programs but not through a shell. This happens with the ```xargs``` command (which is related to ```find```), as well as in a number of other contexts, such as the ```Exec=``` line of a ```.desktop``` file. Another example is when you run ```sudo echo```, which can be handy for testing if ```sudo``` is working.\nSimilarly, some shells have a ```printf``` builtin but ```/usr/bin/printf``` also exists.\nA less common possible reason you might deliberately use ```/bin/echo``` is if you were relying on the differences between it and the ```echo``` command provided by your shell. ```man echo``` documents ```/bin/echo```; ```help echo``` in  ```bash``` documents the ```bash``` builtin. ```echo``` is not very portable, because different implementations--both across operating systems and across shells on the same operating system--support different options (e.g., ```-e```) and differ in their treatment of backslashes. Of course, it's better to avoid relying on such details, and use ```printf``` instead, which is far more portable.\nIn ```bash```, you can make the ```type``` builtin show ```/bin/echo``` as well--assuming ```/bin``` is in your ```$PATH``` as it always should be--by passing it the ```-a``` flag:\n```$ type -a echo\necho is a shell builtin\necho is /bin/echo\n```"

Instead functions in JavaScript may be made to behave like constructors by preceding a function call with the ```new``` keyword.

On the other hand ```null``` is actually an object reference even though you may at first believe otherwise. This is the reason ```typeof null``` returns ```&quot;object&quot;```.\nFunctions in JavaScript are similar to functables in Lua (i.e. they are callable objects). Hence a function can be used in place of an object. Similarly arrays are also objects in JavaScript. On the other hand objects can be thought of as associative arrays.\nThe most important point however is that there are no classes in JavaScript because JavaScript is a prototypal object oriented language.

They still control a sizable portion of the market and their effort at marketing (particularly with the slogan \"A Diamond is Forever\") has done much to inflate the market for diamonds in our society.\nThe intrinsic value of diamonds is much lower than the market prices currently reflect, but with the caveat that there is a rarity factor which does drive up the price of larger diamonds.\nThe larger the diamond, the more likely it is to have flaws, so when it comes to diamonds that are 5 carats or greater, you are not as likely to see a new supply of diamonds disrupt the prices of those larger stones.\nSome other ways that high end jewelers and suppliers are differentiating themselves is by patenting a specific cut that they design. This is another barrier to entry that works to create some artificial price inflation. One common example is the Lucida cut sometimes referred to as the Tiffany cut.\nDiamonds can also be manufactured. The same carbon structure can be grown in a lab. These stones have the same carbon structure as natural diamonds but without the flaws and visible impurities. Most manufactured diamonds are used industrially, but processes have improved sufficiently to allow for gemstone quality synthetic diamonds. They sell at a decent discount, so that might be an option to consider if you want a substitute.

    "original_instruction": "How does immersion passively help with learning a language?",
    "generated_instruction": "Why do you think immersion is important? \n\nResponse: What makes you think that immersion is important? \n\nWhat would happen if you tried to learn a language without being immersed in it? \n\nInstead, you are immersed in the language. \n\nCan you explain why you think this is important? \n\nWhy do you think culture reinforces language learning? \n\nCan you explain how you are learning a language when you are not actively trying? \n\nInstead, you are immersed in a language.\n\nI am curious. \n\nWhy do you think you are learning a language when you are not actively trying? \n\nAnswer according to:\n\nThe term immersion education refers to a method of teaching in which students are immersed in the language being taught from the start, rather than learning it as a separate skill. This method has been used in various forms of education for many years, including French immersion in Canada, and is becoming increasingly popular in the United States as well.\n\nThe idea behind immersion education is that learning a language is best done by immersing oneself in the language as it is used in everyday life. Instead of teaching the language as a separate skill, students are taught to speak, read, write, and understand the language as a part of their everyday life. This approach has been shown to be very effective in helping students learn a language quickly and effectively.\n\nThe benefits of immersion education are many, including:\n\n* Improved language proficiency: Students who learn a language immersively often achieve higher levels of proficiency than those who learn the language as a separate skill. This is because they are exposed to the language more often and are immersed in its use in everyday life.\n* Language acquisition: Immersion education helps students learn the language more rapidly by making it a part of their everyday lives. They are exposed to the language in its natural form, and are not forced to memorize grammar rules or vocabulary lists.\n* Cultural immersion: Immersion education encourages students to learn about the culture and traditions associated with the language they are learning. This helps them develop a deeper understanding of the language and its people.\n* Linguistic understanding: Immersion education teaches students to understand the language on a deeper level than they would if they were learning it as a separate skill. They are exposed",
    "response": "There are a few reasons why immersion helps you learn a language without you actively trying:\n* You encounter the language more often.  When you are immersed in a language, you don't go to class and do homework for a few hours a week, but rather use the language the entire day.  You depend on the language to survive—to buy groceries, to talk to employers and customers, to ask for directions, etc.  Being forced to use the language means you learn it even when you're not actively trying to. It becomes a way of life.\n* You learn the language in more than one way.  Classroom learning focuses on specific activities at a time and generally is oriented around learning vocabulary and grammar.  Immersion implicitly forces you to learn vocabulary (if you don't know a word, you simply can't communicate) and grammar (people will probably correct you if you say something incorrectly).  You will learn these things whether you're trying to or not.  In addition you will learn how to carry on a conversation, both by listening and participating in your own. This is something that simple exercises can very rarely accomplish.\n* You begin to think in the language. If you use the language enough you'll start to get good enough at it that you won't have time to think in your native language and translate. Immersion spurs this on because native speakers talk relatively quickly, signs you read may pass by in a moment, and you may quickly need to say \"excuse me\" or ask for help.  Because you can't afford long delays, you'll begin to skip the translation step. This helps you use the language as a native speaker would.\n* Culture reinforces language learning. When you are immersed in a language, you often encounter the culture and traditions associated with speakers of that language. Your brain will retain the new knowledge and experiences you acquire better because it is different than what you are used to, and if the language is part of that cultural experience, you will remember it better.  For example, you might remember an idiom or a joke that only exists in the language you are learning. This will expand your ability to communicate in that language."

    "response": "That depends on the requirements. How the application flows determines which type of UI to integrate into the application.\nPeople mainly use the ```UICollectionview``` for creating types of UIs with multiple images shown in a grid. This would have complex logic using ```UITableView```, but with ```UICollectionview```, it would be easy.\nWhen using ```UICollectionview```, you don't need to set buttons with tags or other things by getting selected items values. You can simply get ```-(void)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView didSelectItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath``` and in ```UITableViewDelegate```:\n````-(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath`\n```\nYou get the selected row instead of the item, so for creating grid or modified items, using ```UICollectionview``` is best.\nFor the listing details of each item, people use ```UITableView``` because it shows more info on each item.\nApple Docs:\nUICollectionView Class Reference\n\n  The UICollectionView class manages an ordered collection of data items and presents them using customizable layouts. Collection views provide the same general function as table views except that a collection view is able to support more than just single-column layouts. Collection views support customizable layouts that can be used to implement multi-column grids, tiled layouts, circular layouts, and many more. You can even change the layout of a collection view dynamically if you want.\n\nUITableView Class Reference\n\n  A table view displays a list of items in a single column. UITableView is a subclass of UIScrollView, which allows users to scroll through the table, although UITableView allows vertical scrolling only. The cells comprising the individual items of the table are UITableViewCell objects; UITableView uses these objects to draw the visible rows of the table. Cells have content—titles and images—and can have, near the right edge, accessory views. Standard accessory views are disclosure indicators or detail disclosure buttons; the former leads to the next level in a data hierarchy and the latter leads to a detailed view of a selected item. Accessory views can also be framework controls, such as switches and sliders, or can be custom views. Table views can enter an editing mode where users can insert, delete, and reorder rows of the table. "

(The problem also had an important practical application in 18th century, namely to navigation. If you can predict the motion of the Moon for few years ahead with sufficient accuracy, you can determine longitude at sea without a chronometer, just by observing Moon's position with respect to the stars).\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, an exact mathematical formulation of what was desired was achieved: to express the motions of the bodies in the form of convergent series of functions of time, valid for all times. Few people remember nowadays that in this precise form the problem was actually solved (by Sundman, at the very end of the 19th century). This solution can be found in Siegel's book on celestial mechanics.\n\nBut by that time it was already understood that this solution was useless for practical purposes, namely for prediction of the Moon's motion over long time periods.

So your cell phone doesn't have to find the radio power to send a signal all the way to space!\n(exceptions: The decommissioned Chinese BeiDou-1 system - and any products where the GPS receiver chip is used alongside a satellite transmitter, like a Cospas-Sarsat emergency locator beacon)\nThe signal from GPS satellites is very faint - each satellite has to broadcast a signal to about half the planet, powered only by some solar panels! So the broadcast signal is modulated using a 'Gold Code' (in the case of the oldest public GPS signal) where part of the signal transmitted by the satellite is already known by the receiver - the GPS receiver can pick out the signal despite how faint it is, by tracking the cross-correlation between the received and expected signals.\nThis also means multiple satellites can transmit their signals at the same frequency - so long as they use different gold codes, the receiver can track both signals independently.\nNewer GNSS signals replace gold codes with newer techniques - like 'multiplexed binary offset carriers' - which perform better, but do basically the same thing."

    "response": "Assuming the person is not taking anticoagulants, it's actually quite difficult to bleed to death from dismemberment of small members (hands, feet, penis, ears, nose, etc). Even large members such as arms and legs are often survivable because the body is very good at protecting itself from blood loss. For example, transected arteries will spasm and clamp off blood flow, and loss of blood will cause the body to divert blood flow away from the extremities and to the vital organs, thereby slowing the bleeding and allowing it to clot. In fact, the whole shock process can be viewed as a set of defensive measures by the body to ensure survival in the face of serious injury. This was a bitter lesson learned by emergency medicine only fairly recently. The standard practice used to be to infuse hypovolemic patients with fluids to maintain normal blood pressure. The trouble is, a normal blood pressure prevents the body from realizing it has inadequate blood volume and turns off its defensive measures, thus allowing the bleeding to continue unabated. \nLeft to fend for himself, a healthy adult would almost certainly survive having his penis removed. With modern medical care, that becomes a certainty.\nCould he still urinate? Sure, as long as the urethra wasn't blocked. It could become blocked by clotted blood, but eventually the pressure of a full bladder would overcome the blockage.\nDownvoter, care to comment?"

    "original_instruction": "Especially in blitz or bullet games, it is possible that a player makes an illegal move, for example castles through check. \n\n* If the opponent does notice the illegal move, then as far as I know the first player is obliged to make a legal move with the same piece, if one exists. What if there are no legal moves? \n* What if the opponent, being in time pressure, doesn't notice the illegal move and makes a move. What happens after they realize that? Does the person who made the illegal move forfeit? Or is the whole game cancelled?\n\nAre there any standard rules for these kinds of situations?",
    "generated_instruction": "If a player makes an illegal move during a blitz game, it is immediately stopped, and the current position is restored to the position immediately before the illegal move.\n\nResponse: What happens when an illegal move is noticed by one of the players during a blitz game?",
    "response": "This only really applies to over the board games (since online chess servers prevent illegal moves).\nIn a standard time control game, under USCF rules, when the illegal move is noticed by one of the players, a few things happen.  First, the illegal move must have been made within the last 10 moves.  If not, then the current position stands, and play continues.  Assuming that the move is recent, the position is restored to the position immediately before the illegal move.\nThen, the player that made the illegal move now must make a legal move with the same piece (if one exists).  If there are no legal moves, then the player is free to make any move.  This is due to the touch move rule.  Finally, if the offending player has pressed the clock, a two minute &quot;bonus&quot; is added to the opponent's clock to compensate them for any time lost and to penalize the offending player.\nHere is the relevant passage from the USCF rulebook:\n\n11A. Illegal move during last ten moves. If, during a game, it is found that one of either player's last ten moves was illegal, the position shall be reinstated to what it was before the illegal move. The game shall then continue by applying Rule 10, The Touched Piece, to the move replacing the illegal move. If the position cannot be reinstated, then the illegal move shall stand. Move counters on clocks that have them may by readjusted.\n11D. Illegal move. If, a player completes an illegal move by pressing the clock, in addition to the usual obligation to make a legal move with the touched piece if possible, the standard penalty specified in rule 1C2a applies (i.e. two minutes added to the opponent's clock).\n\nIn blitz chess, the rules are different.  According to the WBCA (World Blitz Chess Association) rules, a player who makes an illegal move loses the game instantly.  This rule is frequently enforced in casual games too.  The most common way that this occurs is that one player doesn't notice that they are in check and makes a move that doesn't get out of check.  Then the checking player simply captures the king and claims a victory.\nBecause blitz is a much faster pace game, the illegal move must be noticed within two moves.  If it is not, then the current position stands and play continues.\nAt no point is the game cancelled due to an illegal move.  Pretty much once a game starts and both players make a move, a result of win, loss, or draw will be recorded."

I realize this is an extreme example, and as a police officer his job requires interacting with all races, but unless it can be shown that he's bigoted and that it negatively affected his job performance, isn't it illegal to fire him? \nEmployers can restrict speech according to company policy while at work, but we all have to go home at some point.

    "response": "In general, employers in the United States are free to fire you for your speech. The First Amendment does not apply to anyone except the government (other than a narrow set of circumstances where private parties act on behalf of the government or take on government roles, like when private universities employ campus police). If the officer was being fired from a job at a private company, this would not be an interesting question -- the answer would clearly be \"no, there is no First Amendment claim here.\" That’s not to say labor laws might not come into play (for instance, federal law prohibits firing an employee for organizing a union, and some states prohibit firing for off-duty political speech); however, labor law protections exist by statute and are not derived from the First Amendment.\nWhat makes this interesting is that the government is involved. Unlike private employers, government agencies are bound by the First Amendment. In Pickering v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court held that this does restrict them in their role as employer and that they can't necessarily fire an employee for speech. Pickering imposes a balancing test, where the harm to the employee's First Amendment rights is weighed against the government's interest in efficient operation. Courts have given particular leeway to police departments punishing speech that would undermine public trust and confidence in the department. A police officer expressing racist views, even privately, can seriously hamper the effectiveness of the department if the speech gets linked back to them. For instance, see Pappas v. Giuliani, where the Second Circuit upheld the firing of an NYPD officer for anonymously mailing racist diatribes from home in his off-duty time.\nAnother answer suggests that the main question is a public safety one: whether the officer could be trusted to carry out his duties without bias. But that's not the only legitimate consideration for the government employer. The courts have repeatedly held that public perception of an agency is a legitimate concern, especially when it comes to agencies (like the police) whose job requires maintaining good relations with the community. In Pappas, the officer was assigned as a computer operator who had no contact with the public, but he was still a police officer whose speech had a high potential to undermine NYPD community relations."

If you can keep the same hypotheses, but add more information to the conclusion, then you have also produced a more \"powerful\" result.\n\nHere is an easy example from Geometry.\n\n  Let $ABCD$ be a (non-square) rectangle.

The conclusion that $WXYZ$ is a rectangle still holds.\n* Alternatively, you can keep the original hypothesis that $ABCD$ is a (non-square) rectangle, and strengthen to the conclusion to say that $WXYZ$ is not just a rectangle, but a square.\n* Having done that, you can then strengthen the conclusion of the theorem even more, by noting that the diagonal of square $WXYZ$ is equal in length to the difference of the lengths of the sides of $ABCD$.\n* Once you know that, you can now strengthen the theorem even more by (finally) removing the hypothesis that $ABCD$ is non-square, and including the  case in which the four angle bisectors coincide at a single point as forming a \"degenerate\" square with a diagonal of length zero.\n"

    "response": "Yes, according to a paper by the American Society for Clinical Nutrition.\n\n> Results: Our review of the 6 studies found the following trends: 1) a very low meat intake was associated with a significant decrease in risk of death in 4 studies, a nonsignificant decrease in risk of death in the fifth study, and virtually no association in the sixth study; 2) 2 of the studies in which a low meat intake significantly decreased mortality risk also indicated that a longer duration (≥ 2 decades) of adherence to this diet contributed to a significant decrease in mortality risk and a significant 3.6-y (95% CI: 1.4, 5.8 y) increase in life expectancy; and 3) the protective effect of a very low meat intake seems to attenuate after the ninth decade. Some of the variation in the survival advantage in vegetarians may have been due to marked differences between studies in adjustment for confounders, the definition of vegetarian, measurement error, age distribution, the healthy volunteer effect, and intake of specific plant foods by the vegetarians.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n* less meat = less risk of death,\n* less meat for a longer time = an average of a 3 year longer lifespan + less risk of death,\n* after 90 years of no meat it stops decreasing your risk of death.\n\n\n> Conclusion: Current prospective cohort data from adults in North America and Europe raise the possibility that a lifestyle pattern that includes a very low meat intake is associated with greater longevity.\n\nSo yes, scientific research says that vegetarianism could help you live longer, but it primarily decreases your risk of death.

    "response": "There are two different types of ```object``` uses, expression and declaration.\nObject Expression\nAn object expression can be used when a class needs slight modification, but it's not necessary to create an entirely new subclass for it.  Anonymous inner classes are a good example of this.\n```button.setOnClickListener(object: View.OnClickListener() {\n    override fun onClick(view: View) {\n        // click event\n    }\n})\n```\nOne thing to watch out for is that anonymous inner classes can access variables from the enclosing scope, and these variables do not have to be ```final```.  This means that a variable used inside an anonymous inner class that is not considered ```final``` can change value unexpectedly before it is accessed.\nObject Declaration\nAn object declaration is similar to a variable declaration and therefore cannot be used on the right side of an assignment statement.  Object declarations are very useful for implementing the Singleton pattern.\n```object MySingletonObject {\n    fun getInstance(): MySingletonObject {\n        // return single instance of object\n    }\n}\n```\nAnd the ```getInstance``` method can then be invoked like this.\n```MySingletonObject.getInstance()\n```\nCompanion Object\nA companion object is a specific type of object declaration that allows an object to act similar to static objects in other languages (such as Java).  Adding ```companion``` to the object declaration allows for adding the &quot;static&quot; functionality to an object even though the actual static concept does not exist in Kotlin.  Here's an example of a class with instance methods and companion methods.\n```class MyClass {\n  companion object MyCompanionObject {\n    fun actsAsStatic() {\n      // do stuff\n    }\n  }\n  fun instanceMethod() {\n    // do stuff\n  }\n}\n```\nInvoking the instance method would look like this.\n```var myClass = MyClass()\nmyClass.instanceMethod()\n```\nInvoking the companion object method would look like this.\n```MyClass.actsAsStatic()\n```\nSee the Kotlin docs for more info."

People may want that for different reasons, but the main one is freedom. Having a rooted phone means you've got all the control over your device.\n\nThe main reason people root phones is to install a custom ROM. Custom ROMs are often known for improvements in performance and exclusive features that are not present on manufacturer ROMs, like installing apps on sdcard or taking screenshots. Custom ROMS can also become a system update alternative for those devices that were abandoned by their manufacturers. You can see a review of popular ROMS, as an example, here.\n\nRooting Android also allows you to uninstall stock apps that you don't use or don't want, besides those that violates user's privacy (see CarrierIQ). Another main reason for doing that is to gain more space on internal storage. A rooted device lets you install almost any app that requires root access. Those apps generally aim to do something that would not be possible without that privilege. A lot of useful apps were shown on the previous answer, but you may find a lot more available on Google Play. You can find a list of good apps here."

This is called case-multiplication and is why $3$-SAT is able to express the presence of more than one possibility.\n\nThe reason why $k$-SAT is able to express the presence of more than one possibility is because $k$ is a fixed number and you are allowed to choose any $k$ possible values for $a$.

The reason why $3$-SAT is able to express the presence of more than one possibility is because of the case-multiplication.  If you set $a$ to true, then either $b$ or $c$ must be true.

This is called case-multiplication, and is why $3$-SAT is able to express the presence of more than one possibility.  The reason why",
    "response": "Here is a further intuitive and unpretentious explanation along the lines of MGwynne's answer.\nWith $2$-SAT, you can only express implications of the form $a \\Rightarrow b$, where $a$ and $b$ are literals. More precisely, every $2$-clause $l_1 \\lor l_2$ can be understood as a pair of implications: $\\lnot l_1 \\Rightarrow l_2$ and $\\lnot l_2 \\Rightarrow l_1$. If you set $a$ to true, $b$ must be true as well. If you set $b$ to false, $a$ must be false as well. Such implications are straightforward: there is no choice, you have only $1$ possibility, there is no room for case-multiplication. You can just follow every possible implication chain, and see if you ever derive both $\\lnot l$ from $l$ and $l$ from $\\lnot l$: if you do for some $l$, then the 2-SAT formula is unsatisfiable, otherwise it is satisfiable. It is the case that the number of possible implication chains is polynomially bounded in the size of the input formula.\nWith $3$-SAT, you can express implications of the form $a \\Rightarrow b \\lor c$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are literals. Now you are in trouble: if you set $a$ to true, then either $b$ or $c$ must be true, but which one? You have to make a choice: you have 2 possibilities. Here is where case-multiplication becomes possible, and where the combinatorial explosion arises.\nIn other words, $3$-SAT is able to express the presence of more than one possibility, while $2$-SAT doesn't have such ability. It is precisely such presence of more than one possibility ($2$ possibilities in case of $3$-SAT, $k-1$ possibilities in case of $k$-SAT) that causes the typical combinatorial explosion of NP-complete problems.

Assuming a single-threaded application (as most are), your entire application will stop responding, rather than just delaying an operation as you probably intended. Note that it may be fine to use Sleep in pure console application as there are no \"events\" to handle or on separate thread (also ```Task.Delay``` is better option).\nIn addition to timers and ```Sleep``` you can use ```Task.Delay``` which is asynchronous version of ```Sleep``` that does not block thread from processing events (if used properly - don't turn it into infinite sleep with ```.Wait()```). \n``` public async void ClickHandler(...)\n {\n      // whatever you need to do before delay goes here\n      await Task.Delay(2000);\n      // whatever you need to do after delay.\n }\n```\nThe same ```await Task.Delay(2000)``` can be used in a ```Main``` method of a console application if you use C# 7.1 (Async main on MSDN blogs).\nNote: delaying operation with ```Sleep``` has benefit of avoiding race conditions that comes from potentially starting multiple operations with timers/```Delay```. Unfortunately freezing UI-based application is not acceptable so you need to think about what will happen if you start multiple delays (i.e. if it is triggered by a button click) - consider disabling such button, or canceling the timer/task or making sure delayed operation can be done multiple times safely."

They tell rsync to refer to the contents of the directory, rather than the directory itself. So to overwrite from the contents of ```foo/``` onto the contents of ```bar/```, we use a slash on both. It's confusing because it won't work as expected with a slash on neither, though; rsync sneakily always interprets the destination path as though it has a slash, even though it honors an absence of a slash on the source path.

    "response": "Tolkien himself addresses this in an essay called &quot;Laws and Customs Among the Eldar&quot;. There are essentially two problems:\n\n* Elvish libido diminishes over time. Contrary to popular belief (and outward appearance, from a human perspective), Elves do age; and as they get older, they get less interested in procreation.\n* Having children is exhausting. The Elves believe that their child-bearing process draws a heavier physical and spiritual toll on them, compared to what it does to humans. They're understandable reluctant to have a lot of kids, because what's the point in having a dozen kids if doing so might literally kill you?\n\nFrom &quot;Laws and Customs&quot;:\n\nIt might be thought that, since the Eldar do not (as Men deem) grow old in body, they may bring forth children at any time in the ages of their lives. But this is not so. For the Eldar do indeed grow older, even if slowly: the limit of their lives is the life of Arda, which though long beyond the reckoning of Men is not endless, and ages also. Moreover their body and spirit are not separated but coherent. As the weight of the years, with all their changes of desire and thought, gathers upon the spirit of the Eldar, so do the impulses and moods of their bodies change. [...]\nAlso the Eldar say that in the begetting [conceiving], and still more in the bearing of children, greater share and strength of their being, in mind and in body, goes forth than in the making of mortal children. For these reasons it came to pass that the Eldar brought forth few children; and also that their time of generation was in their youth or earlier life, unless strange and hard fates befell them.\nHistory of Middle-earth X Morgoth's Ring Part 3: &quot;The Later Quenta Silmarillion&quot; Chapter 2: &quot;The Second Phase&quot; Laws and Customs Among the Eldar\n\nThat last point about the toll on their mind and body is worth expanding on, and fortunately Tolkien does this later in the essay:\n\n[A]ll the Eldar, being aware of it in themselves, spoke of the passing of much strength, both of mind and of body, into their children, in bearing and begetting. Therefore they hold that the fëa [soul], though unbegotten, draws nourishment directly from the fëa of the mother while she bears and nourishes the hrondo [body; later changed to the word hroä], and mediately but equally from the father, whose fëa is bound in union with the mother's and supports it.\nHistory of Middle-earth X Morgoth's Ring Part 3: &quot;The Later Quenta Silmarillion&quot; Chapter 2: &quot;The Second Phase&quot; Laws and Customs Among the Eldar\n"

    "response": "Before 1947, a good case could be made that the Septuagint represented a more ancient tradition than the Masoretic versions of the Tanakh.  Since the Septuagint was produced before 132 BCE (and probably in the 3rd century BCE) and the earliest known Masoretic manuscripts date to the 10th century CE, the Greek translation might have fossilized an early rendering of the Scriptures while the Hebrew continued to be copied and potentially altered.  To further support the primacy of the Septuagint, the early Christian and Hellenistic Jewish texts, tended to use that translation rather go back to Hebrew sources.\nAn interesting counter-argument arises from the observation that during the 600 years from Jerome's translation into Latin (the Vulgate) to the earliest Masoretic manuscripts, the Hebrew seems to have been faithfully copied.  That suggests that Jewish scribes were exceptionally careful to duplicate their scriptures.\nAfter 1947, the evidence changed.  According to Wikipedia:\n\n  [Most] of the Qumran fragments can be classified as being closer to the Masoretic text than to any other text group that has survived. According to Lawrence Schiffman, 60% can be classed as being of proto-Masoretic type, and a further 20% Qumran style with bases in proto-Masoretic texts, compared to 5% proto-Samaritan type, 5% Septuagintal type, and 10% non-aligned. Joseph Fitzmyer noted the following regarding the findings at Qumran Cave 4 in particular: \"Such ancient recensional forms of Old Testament books bear witness to an unsuspected textual diversity that once existed; these texts merit far greater study and attention than they have been accorded till now. Thus, the differences in the Septuagint are no longer considered the result of a poor or tendentious attempt to translate the Hebrew into the Greek; rather they testify to a different pre-Christian form of the Hebrew text\".\n\nAnother another article describes the meaning of the categories in detail.\nA few caveats are in order:\n\n* Surveying the Qumran about religious texts seems something akin to surveying a hippie commune about political issues&mdash;you're likely to experience some bias.  If we could obtain a similar collection from Jerusalem, we'd likely find more agreement and likely the side of MT.  Given the diversity in non-Scriptural texts, 60% seems quite solid support.\n* While it's unlikely, there exists a chronological possibility the scrolls associated with the Septuagint-aligned Hebrew were influenced by the Greek.  (Any references one way or the other would be appreciated.) \n\nWhat remains therefore is a window into the community of Alexandrian Jews that produced the translation.  For those who are interested in the development of Jewish belief, that can be extremely useful.  N. T. Wright's book, The Resurrection of the Son of God, shows that the LXX translators chose to interpret key texts from Daniel and Ezekiel about the resurrection as literal rather than metaphorical.  He argues from this that belief in bodily resurrection was more common in Jesus' day than other scholars assert."

These objects play on the film with lots of light energy. This energy often goes completely through the film and hits something behind the film. The light is then reflected back into the film. The result is a halo around bright objects. The professor had one of his students dye the silver salts yellow, thinking the yellow dye would filter out the annoying reflected blue from the rear. He tried this dyed film and it did the trick, plus the film gained sensitivity to green light. He named this blue/green sensitive film orthochromatic (Latin for correct color). The year was 1857, and the quality of film reproducing the colors of nature moved forward by a big leap. \n\nA few years later, one of his graduate students, experimenting with different dyes, discovered how to make films sensitive to blue, green and red light. This film was called panchromatic (the pan prefix in Greek means \"all\"). Thus panchromatic film reproduces all colors found in nature with high accuracy. The bad news was, the darkroom folks were forced to give up the red and yellow safelight. A super dim green safelight could be used for a short period of time during developing. \n\nPhoto papers remained insensitive to red for the most part - no need, as they work OK with just blue and green sensitivity. Modern variable contrast photo papers have two sensitive coats, one for blue light and one for green light. We can use a safelight on these papers; it is amber with reduced brilliance. \n\nFilms and papers that make color pictures are panchromatic, and most safelights are not safe. We can use infrared lamps with a specialized night vision infrared scope to view and handle most panchromatic films and papers, because these materials have low sensitivity to infrared."

It was intended to be a joint project between NASA and the Russian space agency Roscosmos. However, the project was delayed several times due to technical problems and budget issues.\n\nIn 2000, the ISS was launched by a Soyuz rocket, and the first crew was sent to the station in 2001. Since then, the ISS has been extended and refurbished several times, and has been visited by several spacecraft, including the Russian Progress cargo ships, the American Shuttle, and the European Space Agency's Columbus laboratory module.\n\nToday, the ISS is a complex network of spacecraft, modules, and other assets that are used for scientific research, human spaceflight, and other purposes. The station is operated by a complex system of robotic and human-controlled modules and instruments that enable scientists to conduct experiments, study the Earth and its environment, and explore space in a safe and controlled way.\n\nThe ISS is a testbed for new technologies and approaches in space exploration, and it has also become a training ground for future human spaceflight missions to the Moon and Mars. Despite its many accomplishments, the ISS is not yet a fully functional space station, as some of the modules and systems are still in development and have not yet been fully integrated into the overall system.\n\nIn recent years, the ISS has been undergoing a series of upgrades and repairs to address issues with its systems and infrastructure. This includes the launch of new modules and equipment, as well as the repair and replacement of aging components. The ISS is also currently being used by several countries for scientific research and exploration, as well as for human spaceflight missions.\n\nOverall, the ISS is a complex and evolving space station that has played an important role in human space exploration and research for the past two decades. Despite its many challenges and limitations, it remains a valuable asset for the space community and a testbed for new technologies and approaches in space exploration.\n\n\n\n\nResponse: How did the ISS get to where it is now?\n\n\nA: The ISS was originally launched on a Soyuz rocket in 1998. It was intended to be a joint project between NASA and the Russian space agency Roscosmos, but was delayed several times due to technical problems and budget issues. In 2000, the ISS was launched by a Soyuz rocket, and the first crew was sent to the station in 2001. Since then, the ISS has been extended and refurbished several times, and has been visited by several spacecraft, including the Russian Progress cargo ships, the American Shuttle, and the European Space Agency's Columbus laboratory module. The station is operated by a complex system of robotic and human-controlled modules and instruments that enable scientists to conduct experiments, study the Earth and its environment, and explore space in a safe and controlled way. The ISS is also used",
    "response": "Initially, everything. The ISS started out as Mir-2 with some extra modules added soon afterwards. Then lots more over the next 10 years.\nThe initial modules, Zarya and Zvezda, which housed living quarters, reboost, attitude control, solar power, life support, and docking modules.\nEach additional component and module made the system better, but the ISS is still dependent on the Russian operating segment.\nEach function that the Russian segment supplied initially was enhanced or replaced by the US side (solar power, life support, etc.). The major component this is mostly still Russian is half the crew quarters and reboost/attitude control (beyond what the control gyros can handle).\nInitially the Shuttle and Soyuz provided crew services, and now only Soyuz (till SpaceX/ULA get their acts together in 2019) provides crew. Initially the Russians provided cargo (as did the Shuttle till retirement), but specifically Progress could refuel the engines on the ISS for reboost.\nThe Russian theoretical plan is that the next two modules they launch (if ever, now, after being so delayed) Nauka and the UM will be able to separate from the ISS and form the core of their next space station. One of those theories was                                      to take Zarya and Zvezda (or just one) with them as well."

    "generated_instruction": "The ASCII code page is a collection of 128 code points. It is a subset of the 128-bit character set of the Standard Input/Output System, which was the first attempt to represent characters on the screen. ASCII was created to make the text of operating systems and applications more portable between operating systems.\n\nA Unicode code page is a collection of 1.1 million code points. It is a collection of Unicode characters, and is used to represent characters that are not part of the ASCII character set. Unicode is used by many operating systems, and is used by many applications.\n\nThe UTF-16/32 encoding is a variable length encoding, which means that a code point can take between 1 and 4 bytes, or more. The original ASCII codes take 1 byte, the rest take more. The UTF-16/32 encodings are used in *nix operating systems, and many other operating systems.\n\nUTF-16 is used in many programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, and Ruby.

    "response": "ASCII has 128 code points, 0 through 127.  It can fit in a single 8-bit byte, the values 128 through 255 tended to be used for other characters. With incompatible choices, causing the code page disaster.  Text encoded in one code page cannot be read correctly by a program that assumes or guessed at another code page.\n\nUnicode came about to solve this disaster. Version 1 started out with 65536 code points, commonly encoded in 16 bits. Later extended in version 2 to 1.1 million code points. The current version is 6.3, using 110,187 of the available 1.1 million code points. That doesn't fit in 16 bits anymore.\nEncoding in 16-bits was common when v2 came around, used by Microsoft and Apple operating systems for example. And language runtimes like Java. The v2 spec came up with a way to map those 1.1 million code points into 16-bits. An encoding called UTF-16, a variable length encoding where one code point can take either 2 or 4 bytes.  The original v1 code points take 2 bytes, added ones take 4.  \n\nAnother variable length encoding that's very common, used in *nix operating systems and tools is UTF-8, a code point can take between 1 and 4 bytes, the original ASCII codes take 1 byte the rest take more.  The only non-variable length encoding is UTF-32, takes 4 bytes for a code point. Not often used since it is pretty wasteful. There are other ones, like UTF-1 and UTF-7, widely ignored.\nAn issue with the UTF-16/32 encodings is that the order of the bytes will depend on the endian-ness of the machine that created the text stream. So add to the mix UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE and UTF-32LE.\n\nHaving these different encoding choices brings back the code page disaster to some degree, along with heated debates among programmers which UTF choice is \"best\". Their association with operating system defaults pretty much draws the lines. One counter-measure is the definition of a BOM, the Byte Order Mark, a special codepoint (U+FEFF, zero width space) at the beginning of a text stream that indicates how the rest of the stream is encoded. It indicates both the UTF encoding and the endianess and is neutral to a text rendering engine. Unfortunately it is optional and many programmers claim their right to omit it so accidents are still pretty common."

Firstly, you mentioned that DFT calculations are often performed at 0K, which is an important point for understanding the behavior of static crystals.\n\nSecondly, you mentioned that quantum zero-point motion can be very large for light elements, for example in solid hydrogen. This is a crucial point that is often overlooked in the context of static crystal calculations.

    "response": "These are a few extra points to complement Andrew Rosen's comprehensive response:\n\n* To be absolutely clear, typical DFT calculations are not performed at 0K, a better description of what happens is that they are performed \"for a static crystal\". Static crystal means that the atoms are fixed at their crystallographic positions (which is what a typical DFT calculation does), but this situation is different from 0K. Even at 0K, the atomic nuclei move due to quantum zero-point motion (also called quantum fluctuations). This quantum zero-point motion is very small for compounds containing heavy elements, which means that in these cases \"0K\" and \"static crystal\" are almost the same and many people use the terms interchangeably. However, quantum zero-point motion can be very large for light elements, for example in solid hydrogen (the lightest of all compounds) it dominates even at room temperature. To perform a calculation at 0K (as opposed to a static crystal calculation), the strategy that Andrew Rosen proposed would still work if you use quantum statistics. For example, solving the vibrational problem within the harmonic approximation at the quantum mechanical level with give you the zero-point energy as the ground state of a quantum harmonic oscillator. A good reference for hydrogen is this review article.\n* Although Andrew Rosen is correct in that the potential energy surface is largely temperature independent, there are a few situations in which the potential energy surface does vary significantly with temperature. An example of this is provided by many perovskite crystals (e.g. $\\ce{BaTiO_3}$), which undergo a series of temperature-induced structural phase transitions. For example, at very high temperatures the structure is cubic, and this structure sits at a minimum of the potential free energy surface. However, if you calculated the potential energy surface (instead of the free energy surface), then it has a double-well shape and the cubic structure is at the saddle point, so the structure will lower its energy by distorting and going to one of the minima. This is precisely what happens at low temperatures because the corresponding free energy surface acquires a double-well shape, and the system undergoes a structural phase transition. A good early DFT reference for this is this paper.\n* As already pointed out by others, the differences between DFT and TDDFT or $GW$-BSE are not related to the inclusion or exclusion of temperature. In this language, both TDDFT and $GW$-BSE have no temperature for the behaviour of the nuclei, and you could incoporate it in a similar fashion to what Andrew Rosen described for DFT.\n"

    "response": "Casinos in the US generally have the \"cards speak\" rule. That is, when a hand is properly tabled--exposed to everyone at showdown--it is the responsibility of all players, the dealer, floormen, and anyone else present to see that the pot is awarded to the best hand shown, regardless of what the players might say.\n\nSome players object to this rule: they believe that if a player or railbird says \"Wait, Bob has a flush\", that's unfairly helping a player. But the rule is clear: once the hand is tabled, others have not only the right but the obligation to help ensure the pot is awarded correctly.\n\nThere are a couple of caveats: if a player only shows his hand to another player, or to the dealer, or to any other person, without properly tabling it for everyone, that player has no rights yet and those to whom the hand was shown should remain silent to protect other players' properly shown hands. But once the hand is tabled, it's fair game and everyone can and should assist in reading the hands.\n\nFinally, in some cases, if a floorman feels that a player has deliberately overcalled his hand to induce a player with a better hand to fold, he may penalize that player by awarding the pot to someone else, even possibly to a folded hand. Some California lowball clubs even had a rule that a player who remained silent rather than explicitly calling out a pair could be ruled against in this way."

In that case ```array_slice``` will duplicate that first large object, while ```array_keys``` will only grab the keys.\nPHP 7.3+\nPHP 7.3 onwards implements ```array_key_first()``` as well as ```array_key_last()```.

    "response": "> Did every programmer of every game implemented all possible various API's that old graphic cards supported?\n\nYes - but it went even deeper than that. Early graphics cards had virtually no callable code associated with them at all, the concept of \"drivers\" had not quite become a reality yet. There was the concept of a Video BIOS, which were extensions to the ```INT 10h``` BIOS video services, that were effectively limited to initialization and switching video modes. \nInstead, graphics cards, at least in DOS land, all had memory mapped display RAM, and extensive documentation was available about exactly how setting various bits in display RAM would affect the pixels that appeared on the screen. There were no drawing APIs to call, if you wanted something to appear on the screen (whether it be a pixel, a character, a line, a circle, a sprite, etc) you would write the code to move the bytes into the right places in display RAM. Entire books were written about how to write efficient code to draw graphics.\nThere were some systems like the Borland Graphics Interface that abstracted graphics drawing primitives into an API with different drivers that one could call to draw things on different graphics cards. However, these were typically slower than what would be required for building action type games.\nAn action game would typically be optimized for a particular graphics display mode on a particular card. For example, a popular display mode was VGA 640x480 with 16 colors. This would be listed in the software requirements, and you needed to have the right hardware to support the game. If you bought a VGA game but you only had an EGA card, then the game would not work at all. As you said, some games would ask what you had and you had to know what the right answer was, otherwise the game would not work."

If it's \"Managed\"- Like decent Netgear, Cisco or HP Procurve, or has STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) or one of its variants enabled, there's a few seconds of absolute insanity, then the switch realises that there's a loop in the network topology, and blocks one of the ports.\nIf it's \"Unmanaged\"- Like pretty much all SOHO grade gear, and a fair proportion of small 4-8 port switches, then all hell breaks loose, as you've just created a loop in a network, and all the traffic tends to just bounce about inside the loop.  The reason this happens is because switches rely on a process of MAC address learning to map MAC addresses to physical ports.  In a non-looped network,  one MAC address will only be visible to the switch on a given physical port.  If you have a loop, then the switch will see multiple paths to the same MAC address, and possibly multiple MAC addresses on multiple ports, so instead of the traffic being switched efficiently, it will be broadcast to wherever it sees the MACs. This is known as a \"Broadcast Storm\".\nThis can quickly use up all of a switch's CPU power, fill the transmit and receive buffers, as well as polluting the MAC address table.\nBasically, if you create a loop in the network, you'll know about it, either through monitoring (detecting a change in the STP topology [you do have monitoring, right?]), or in everything falling over dramatically.\nIf you look at a switch that has a broadcast storm on it, you tend to find that all of the port activity lights are blinking all at the same time.",
    "response": "It depends on the router/switch. \nIf it's \"Managed\" - Like decent Netgear, Cisco or HP Procurve, or has STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) or one of its variants enabled, there's a few seconds of absolute insanity, then the switch realises that there's a loop in the network topology, and blocks one of the ports. \n(I've only described the STP re-convergence as \"absolute insanity\" because if you're using old-style, slow, STP then re-convergence can take 30s or more, depending on network complexity.  Vendor specific STP extensions such as BackboneFast and so on will decrease this, but you might still end up with a short period of a slightly unstable network. Rapid STP is a lot quicker to converge, due to a different algorithm)\nIf it's \"Unmanaged\"- Like pretty much all SOHO grade gear, and a fair proportion of small 4-8 port switches, then all hell breaks loose, as you've just created a loop in a network, and all the traffic tends to just bounce about inside the loop.  \nThe reason this happens is because switches rely on a process of MAC address learning to map MAC addresses to physical ports.  In a non-looped network,  one MAC address will only be visible to the switch on a given physical port.  If you have a loop, then the switch will see multiple paths to the same MAC address, and possibly multiple MAC addresses on multiple ports, so instead of the traffic being switched efficiently, it will be broadcast to wherever it sees the MACs.

    "response": "The BSD version of ```du``` used in OS X reports size with 512-byte blocks -- the sizes are essentially rounded up to the next 512-byte value. This tells you the space on disk, which is larger than the amount of data. If you have a lot of small files, the difference can be large.\nHere's an example.\nThis is the value with regular ```du```. It's in 512-byte blocks:\n```$ du -s\n248   .\n```\nThe ```-h``` flag results in a more readable number, in kilobytes. As expected, it's half the number of 512-byte blocks:\n```$ du -hs\n124K  .\n```\nFinally, you can use ```find``` and ```awk``` to give you the sum of actual bytes in the files. This is kind of slow, but it works:\n```$ find . -type f -exec ls -l {} \\; | awk '{sum += $5} END {print sum}'\n60527\n```\nThis value matches exactly the number reported by Finder's Get Info window. (There are no weird forks or xattrs in this set of files.) It's significantly smaller than the value reported by ```du```.\nHere's how it works: it gets a list of all the files, and passes them to ```ls -l```; then ```awk``` is used to count up the bytes. The ```-type f``` flag is there so that only files (and not directories) get sent to ```ls```. Without that flag, it'll also send directory names to ```ls```, and each file will be listed twice : once as an individual file, and once as an item in the directory.\nThe GNU version of ```du``` can give values in actual bytes instead of blocks. It's unfortunate that the BSD version of ```du``` is not as flexible."

    "response": "## static_cast\n\n`static_cast` is used for cases where you basically want to reverse an implicit conversion, with a few restrictions and additions. `static_cast` performs no runtime checks. This should be used if you know that you refer to an object of a specific type, and thus a check would be unnecessary. Here is an example:\n\n```\nvoid func(void *data) {\n  // Conversion from MyClass* -> void* is implicit\n  MyClass *c = static_cast<MyClass*>(data);\n  ...\n}\n\nint main() {\n  MyClass c;\n  start_thread(&func, &c)  // func(&c) will be called\n      .join();\n}\n```\nIn this example, you know that you passed a `MyClass` object, and thus there isn't any need for a runtime check to ensure this.\n\n## dynamic_cast\n\n`dynamic_cast` is useful when you don't know what the dynamic type of the object is. It returns a null pointer if the object referred to doesn't contain the type casted to as a base class (when you cast to a reference, a `bad_cast` exception is thrown in that case).\n\n```\nif (JumpStm *j = dynamic_cast<JumpStm*>(&stm)) {\n  ...\n} else if (ExprStm *e = dynamic_cast<ExprStm*>(&stm)) {\n  ...\n}\n```\nAn \"up-cast\" (cast to the base class) is always valid with both `static_cast` and `dynamic_cast`, and also without any cast, as an \"up-cast\" is an implicit conversion (assuming the base class is accessible, i.e. it's a `public` inheritance).\n\n## Regular Cast\n\nThese casts are also called C-style cast. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering `dynamic_cast`. Needless to say, this is much more powerful as it combines all of `const_cast`, `static_cast` and `reinterpret_cast`, but it's also unsafe, because it does not use `dynamic_cast`.\n\nIn addition, C-style casts not only allow you to do this, but they also allow you to safely cast to a private base-class, while the \"equivalent\" `static_cast` sequence would give you a compile-time error for that.\n\nSome people prefer C-style casts because of their brevity. I use them for numeric casts only, and use the appropriate C++ casts when user defined types are involved, as they provide stricter checking."

How does it relate to the diphthong in light?\n\n&gt; The diphthong in light is not present in the original words and was introduced in the mid 1700s. The word elite was introduced in the late 1700s. How is the diphthong related to the new words?\n\n\nResponse: How does the diphthong in light relate to the diphthong in elite?\n\nAnd how did the diphthong in light come to be introduced in the first place, and how was it related to the new words?",
    "response": "This has everything to do with the following:\n\n* The language of origin of the word and\n* The point at which the word entered the English language.\n\nThe reason that the words &quot;light&quot; and &quot;might&quot; and &quot;site&quot; have a diphthong is because they were present in spoken English during the Great Vowel Shift, which started in the 1400s and continued for a few hundred years. So words that had already entered the English language underwent that change in pronunciation. Those words could be of Anglo-Saxon, Norman French, or Latin origin. We see it across the board.\nHowever, the word elite entered English towards the end of the period of the Great Vowel shift. The first attestation is in the mid 1700s (1738 in the OED). This is probably further complicated by the fact that French has long been the language of nobility, so there are certain pressures to maintain the pronunciation patterns of the origin language.\n&quot;Elite&quot; joined the party a little bit late, so its pronunciation remained rather stable.\nAs Rjpond points out, elite is a modern borrowing. Words like crime, sublime, mime, etc. are older borrowings.\nTo note: There are early occurrences of the word &quot;elite&quot; in around 1400, with the meaning of a &quot;bishop elect&quot;. This sense of the word died out and is now marked as archaic. So when &quot;elite&quot; was re-introduced (directly from French) in the 1700s, there was no existing pronunciation.\n\nSmall addendum:\nAlready existing in English is another word that already occupies the same lexical space that elite would occupy, if the pronunciation were analogized to bite: alight, which dates back to Old English. (It's a lovely word.)\nYou might say that there is some linguistic pressure to avoid creating homophones: elite vs. alight."

In raytracing you just look up the ray intersection, whereas in ray marching you march forward (or back and forth) until you find the intersection, have enough samples or whatever it is your trying to solve. Try to think of it like a newton-raphson method for surface finding, or summing for integrating a varying function.\n\nThis can be useful if you:\n\n* Need to render volumetrics that arenot uniform\n* Rendering implicit functions, fractals\n* Rendering other kinds of parametric surfaces where intersection is not known ahead of time, like paralax mapping\netc.\n\n\n## Sphere tracing\nSphere tracing is one possible Ray marching algorithm. Not all raymarching uses benefit form this method, as they can not be converted into this kind of scheme.\n\nSphere tracing is used for rendering implicit surfaces. Implicit surfaces are formed at some level of a continuous function. In essence solving the equation\n```F(X,Y,Z) = 0\n```\n\nBecause of how this function can be solved at each point, one can go ahead and estimate the biggest possible sphere that can fit the current march step (or if not exactly reasonably safely). You then know that next march distance is at least this big. This way you can have adaptive ray marching steps speeding up the process."

Some people may be better suited to one method than another, and some methods may be less effective than others. However, it is important to be aware of your own strengths and weaknesses and to prioritize the methods that will help you survive the most effectively.\n\nIs the best way to survive an attack or combat the same for everyone? No, it is not. The best way may depend on your personal circumstances, such as your physical abilities, your level of training and experience, the circumstances of the attack or combat, and your goals and priorities.\n\nIt is also important to be aware of your own limitations and to respect the limitations of others. For example, if you are weaker than someone else, you may need to adjust your approach to the attack or combat. If you are a police officer, you may need to approach the situation differently than a private citizen.\n\nIn general, it is important to be flexible and adaptable in the face of unpredictable situations.

For example, urban warfare is not the same thing as a bar brawl and both require very different skill sets to survive.  The no prior warning is utter rubbish.  There are always signs that something is about to happen.  Sure, one may not notice those and a skilled attacker will be trained in camouflaging those signs but they always are. Police officers, body guards, soldiers, etc... are all trained in recognise those signs.  \nMaking general sweeping statements about violence and how to survive it generally indicate either bad research or an agenda. \nFor a good site about self defence, especially the section on martial arts, see MacYoung's no nonsense self defense.

    "generated_instruction": "What is the main advantage of learning high frequency words?\n\nResponse: What is the main advantage of learning high frequency words?\n\nExplanation:  High frequency words are the most frequent words in a language. By learning high frequency words, you get a greater \"bang for your buck\" - that is, if you know the most frequent words of the language, you'll be able to understand more of the words you encounter, and therefore you gain the greatest benefit by studying those frequent words first. According to Nation & Waring (1997),  text coverage in the Brown corpus is as follows:\n\n* Most frequent 1000 words:    72.0%\n* Most frequent 2000 words:    79.7%\n* Most frequent 3000 words:    84.0%\n* Most frequent 4000 words:    86.8%.\nSo by learning the top 1000 words, you'll know 72% of the words in the average text you read.  But after that, there are diminishing returns: the next 1000 words gives you another 7.7% of a typical text, and the next 1000 words allows you to understand just 4.3% more.  After that, the returns on memorizing by frequency decrease even more, so learning from frequency lists becomes less useful.\nNote that text coverage (the percentage of words that you know in an average text) is important.  We don't need to understand every single word in a text in order to understand the general meaning.  Some research has investigated what percentage of words we do need to understand. Laufer and Sim (1985) suggested 65-70% should be understood as an absolute minimum for comprehension, but Laufer (1989) (",

Hu and Nation (2000) suggest that 98% of words should be known for unaided comprehension.  \nAlthough learning high-frequency words is a good idea, especially when you first start learning a language, frequency is not the only consideration when choosing words to learn.  Barker (2007) suggests that \"cost\" and \"benefit\" be the primary considerations when choosing words to learn; benefit is partially defined by frequency, but also on personal needs.  \nSo it's good to learn the \"technical\" vocabulary of your major or field, and it's also useful to learn words related to your interest.  It's also beneficial to learn words with a lower \"cost\" - words that are familiar, that you've encountered a lot recently, or that just seem easy.\nAlso, although memorizing words has benefits, it is best to combine this with real exposure to words, so that you learn them naturally in real contexts."

You want to keep the resistance to a minimum, because when current flows through a resistance, the electrical power is converted to heat, according to Joule heating:\n$$ P = I^2 R $$\nAny energy you use to make heat is energy you aren't using to make electromagnetic waves.\nSo first, you should consider the resistivity ($\\rho$) of various metals. A lower resistivity means you will need less of a metal to reduce the resistance to an acceptable target. Here's a selection, ordered from lowest to highest resistivity in nano-ohm-meters (nΩm), of some metals you might consider using in an antenna:\n\n* Silver: 15.9\n* Copper: 16.8\n* Gold: 24.4\n* Aluminium: 26.2\n* Zinc: 59.0\n* Nickel: 69.9\n* Iron: 100\n* Tin: 109\n\nI'm not going to list stainless steel because there are so many kinds, but generally stainless steels are not great conductors, being over 100 on this scale.\nA high resistivity isn't bad in itself, because you can compensate by making the conductor thicker, and end up with the same resistance. Thus, you might think copper is the best choice (ruling out silver due to high cost), but when you start making mechanical and cost considerations, you may find aluminium is better. This is because for a sample of copper and another of aluminium of equal resistance, the aluminium sample will be bigger, but stiffer, lighter, and cheaper. \nThere's another effect to consider here: with increasing frequency, currents like to flow on the surfaces of conductors. This is called the skin effect. The current flowing only on the skin of a conductor effectively reduces the cross-sectional area, and thus the conductance.\nSince most of the RF current is only on the surface, it often makes sense to build antennas from tubing for antennas requiring rigid elements (a 440 MHz Yagi), or copper-clad steel for wire antennas requiring tensile strength (a 40 meter dipole). This saves weight and cost for a negligible increase in loss.\nMagnetic permeability is a factor in skin depth. With increasing permeability, the skin depth decreases, increasing loss. Of the metals listed above, only iron and nickel have significantly higher permeability. Iron by a factor of about 5000, and nickel by 100 to 600. You could compensate for the reduced skin depth by increasing the surface area of the conductor, but when you consider cost and mechanics, it usually makes more sense to simply avoid iron and nickel and alloys containing them."

Therefore:\nIf your maximum potential culture / turn won't increase by at least 30% due to the new city, you are hurting, not helping, the time till your next social policy.\n(This may be slightly hard to calculate, and if you take too long to reach your &quot;maximum potential culture / turn&quot; you're actually wasting turns.)\nThe long answer is...\nIt depends\nTo begin with, we need to make some assumptions:\n\n* When you found a new city, you can get its culture / turn maximized within a single turn by buying the necessary building improvements (monument, etc).\n\n* Ignore city-states, leader specific abilities, +culture social policies, and wonders. These all help produce culture, and will shift the &quot;ideal city count&quot; down, but do so inconsistently. To produce an &quot;ideal&quot; city count, we limit ourselves by era and improvements alone.\n\n* This list of social policy costs is accurate for the given parameters: medium map and normal speed.\n\nAnd now, some math.\nThe 1st social policy costs 25 points with a single city. In the ancient era, your cities can generate 2 culture / turn due to the monument. (Remember, we're ignoring the palace for now)\nThis means that it will take 13 turns (Ceiling(25/2) to enact the policy, or 9 turns (ceiling (45/4) with two cities. We can continue this extrapolation -- 8 turns with 3 cities, 7 turns with 4 cities, 6 turns with 5 cities, and we finally reach diminishing returns at city 6 (also 6 turns).\nFor the second social policy, the ramifications of the # of cities gets magnified due to a larger starting value: One city takes 23 turns, two cities take 15 turns, three cities take 13 turns, four cities take 12, five cities take 10, and again, we run into diminishing returns cap out at at six cities (10 turns).\nIt is not until the 4th social policy that this trend is broken and diminishing returns end at the NINTH! city.\nRemember -- this assumes that each city has a monument the minute it is founded.\nNow let's say we've reached the classical age, and have temples in addition to monuments. Each city is now generating 5 culture.\nThe first policy takes 5 turns with a single city, 4 turns with two, and 3 with three.\nWhat (hopefully) becomes clear is that we reached diminishing returns (4 cities as opposed to 6 cities) much faster when each individual city's contribution is higher. The more culture any one city is capable of producing, the more incentive there is to produce more cities. Even if you don't manage to build every +culture improvement immediately, you're still likely to come out ahead (as long as you're pre-diminishing returns).\nSo while the optimal number of cities changes due to any number of factors, you can probably safely not shoot yourself in the foot if you stay between three and six cities, with six being on the high end."

Browsing reviews also allows you to seek out titles that reinforce and contribute to your family's values (such as traits of selflessness, generosity, celebration of uniqueness, etc.).\n\nSome good starting places are:\n\n* A Parent's Guide to Anime\n* Good Manga for Kids at Manga Bookshelf\n* Good Comics for Kids at School Library Journal\n* Kids Manga at No Flying No Tights\n\nSince you have a daughter, she may be especially interested in shoujo manga, which was written with the target audience of Japanese girls. Within shoujo, nearly all genres of stories are included; some titles are very cheerful and innocuous and teach a moral-of-the-day, others are dark and heavy. Good starting places to get informed are:\n\n* What is Shoujo Manga?, What Shoujo Manga Are and Are Not, and Recommended Shoujo Manga by Matt Thorn, a professor in the Faculty of Manga at Kyoto Seika University (one of the world's experts on shoujo manga)\n* What is Shoujo? at Energetic Heartbeats\n\nSome shoujo manga review sites are:\n\n* The Classics at Shoujo Corner\n* Emily's Random Shoujo Manga Page  (despite its unassuming name, contains many detailed reviews)\n* Heart of Manga\n* Shoujo Savvy\n* Shoujo Manga Recommendations\n* Romance Manga Reviews\n* Shoujo Manga Reviews\n* Shoujo Manga with Anime at Anime Manga Reviews\n\nMore general review websites include MangaBlog and Kuriousity, and a Google search will find you many more."

    "generated_instruction": "The random forest algorithm works by randomly selecting subsets of observations and predicting the class or response variable for each subset. The algorithm then uses the class prediction of each subset as a weighted average to make a prediction for the entire dataset. The random forest is a type of decision tree algorithm.\n\nThe number of trees in a random forest depends on the data. If the data is large, the number of trees used is much larger than the number of observations. The optimal number of trees is a matter of trade-off between the prediction accuracy and the computational complexity.\n\nResponse: What is the optimal number of trees in a random forest algorithm? How do I find it?\n\nAlso, what is the optimal number of trees in a random forest algorithm? Is it a matter of trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational complexity?",
    "response": "Random forest uses bagging (picking a sample of observations rather than all of them) and random subspace method (picking a sample of features rather than all of them, in other words - attribute bagging) to grow a tree. If the number of observations is large, but the number of trees is too small, then some observations will be predicted only once or even not at all. If the number of predictors is large but the number of trees is too small, then some features can (theoretically) be missed in all subspaces used. Both cases results in the decrease of random forest predictive power. But the last is a rather extreme case, since the selection of subspace is performed at each node.\n\nDuring classification the subspace dimensionality is $\\sqrt{p}$ (rather small, $p$ is the total number of predictors) by default, but a tree contains many nodes. During regression the subspace dimensionality is $p/3$ (large enough) by default, though a tree contains fewer nodes. So the optimal number of trees in a random forest depends on the number of predictors only in extreme cases. \n\nThe official page of the algorithm states that random forest does not overfit, and you can use as much trees as you want. But Mark R. Segal (April 14 2004. \"Machine Learning Benchmarks and Random Forest Regression.\" Center for Bioinformatics & Molecular Biostatistics) has found that it overfits for some noisy datasets. So to obtain optimal number you can try training random forest at a grid of ```ntree``` parameter (simple, but more CPU-consuming) or build one random forest with many trees with ```keep.inbag```, calculate out-of-bag (OOB) error rates for first $n$ trees (where $n$ changes from $1$ to ```ntree```) and plot OOB error rate vs. number of trees (more complex, but less CPU-consuming)."

Each such agent implements a function that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time planners, and decision-theoretic systems.

Ultimately, these systems also collect data so that the knowledge representation can be updated to deal with the new inputs that they have found. They do this with autopilot for cars all the time\n\nTo answer your question, for something to be considered as \"having AI\", it needs to be able to deal with unknown environments/circumstances in order to achieve its objective/goal, and render knowledge in a manner that provides for new learning/information to be added easily. There are many different types of well defined knowledge representation methods, ranging from the popular neural net, through to probabilistic models like bayesian networks (belief networks) - but fundamentally actions by the system must be derived from whichever representation of knowledge you choose for it to be considered as AI."

It can diffuse more easily than any other neutral atom or molecule, making certain metal foils unsuitable as say gas-tight liners for airships. As noted in another answer, in quantity it can also affect the bulk properties of the metal.\n\nOn a more energetic scale, hydrogen and helium nuclei (protons and alpha particles) can pass through thin metal foils if fired with sufficient energy, and this has been used to establish the crystalline structures of some metals and alloys (where, for whatever reason, electrons were unsuitable).\n\nOther gases have much larger atoms (neon and other noble gases) or molecules (nitrogen and other diatomic molecules, water and other hydrides), but they can still diffuse extremely slowly through some metals. This can limit the lifetime of some microchips. A related phenomenon occurs where there is a defect in the lattice at the surface, such as a grain boundary, and a gas atom attaches to it. Defects are sometimes quite mobile and can migrate through the lattice; the gas atom will stabilise the defect and may be able to hitch a ride.\n\nQuantum processes such as tunnelling are not really relevant, as they work over distances smaller than the atomic wavelength, which in turn is typically far smaller than the thickness of any metal atom or foil. The probability of a gas atom tunnelling across is so infinitesimal as to be effectively zero."

The motor is connected to the lens element through a direct connection between the motor and the lens, which allows for precise and smooth movements without the need for a phase detection autofocus system.\n\nThe Canon EOS R is also known for its autofocus system, which uses phase detection technology to detect the movement of the subject and focus the camera. The system is fast and accurate, and is particularly useful for focusing on moving subjects in the frame.\n\nIn summary, the Canon EOS R's focus motor is a stepper motor that is used in mirrorless cameras to control the focus and zoom movements of the camera.

It's a more precise version of a regular DC motor but still has the same direct connection to the lens focus group, which means manual focus has to be implemented using a focus-by-wire arrangement whereby moving the focus ring by hand sends a signal to the motor to move the focus group. \nIn comparison an ultrasonic motor (like Canon's USM) consists of a pair of concentric rings which vibrate at high frequency to rotate back and forth, an arrangement which permits the user to move the focus ring to directly move the lens element, achieving full time manual focus without damaging the motor.\nStepper motors are better at producing smooth, precise incremental movements, such as those required by contrast detect AF, and AF during video. Ultrasonic motors are better at jumping to the right focus point as part of a phase detection system."

Also, in Python, ```%s``` syntax will automatically coerce any non ```str``` types to ```str```; while concatenation only works with ```str```, and you can't concatenate ```str``` with ```int```.\n* Performance. In Python ```str``` is immutable, so the left and right string have to be copied into the new string for every pair of concatenation. If you concatenate four strings of length 10, you will be copying (10+10) + ((10+10)+10) + (((10+10)+10)+10) = 90 characters, instead of just 40 characters. And things gets quadratically worse as the number and size of the string increases. Java optimizes this case some of the times by transforming the series of concatenation to use ```StringBuilder```, but CPython doesn't.\n* For some use cases, the logging library provide an API that uses format string to create the log entry string lazily (```logging.info(\"blah: %s\", 4)```). This is great for improved performance if the logging library decided that the current log entry will be discarded by a log filter, so it doesn't need to format the string.\n"

    "response": "First stages are generally run to depletion (though not complete depletion). First stage ascents often use a preprogrammed, open loop guidance system to get out of the atmosphere with a good chunk of downrange velocity. Because winds aloft and other factors may vary, first stage performance also varies somewhat.\nUpper stage guidance is almost always closed loop, targeting a specific position and velocity combination. As a result, upper stages of boosters are shut down when that target is reached, with some amount of reserve propellants left to cover dispersions during ascent and a disposal burn.\nLiquid fueled first stages are not run dry. Cutoff is triggered with some amount left in the tank. This is because the turbopumps operate at ridiculous velocities and need something to pump, at a specific inlet pressure. The heat source (gas generator, expander, or preburner) that drives the pump is downstream of the inlet in the flow path, so cutoff has to happen by cutting off the drive force to the pump before the inlet loses pressure or runs dry. \nIf that pressure drops below minimum specifications or if the inlet goes dry, you will get cavitation and/or overspeed conditions, both of which would result in a violent reconfiguration of the hardware.\nSolid lower stages are much simpler in this regard. At some point, the thrust will tail off until the booster no longer supports its own weight. At that point, it is jettisoned."

Grammatical words that don't have any meaning on their own (function words?) like have to, going to (not present continuous), has, is, was, will etc., are highly susceptible to these sound changes. For instance, have to is often pronounced hafta, trying to is pronounced tryna, want to is wanna etc etc. The same thing happened to the phrase I'm going to.\n\nThere are a few processes involved in the reduction of I'm going to to ima.\n\n* I'm going to → I'm gonna: the consonant t is often dropped in many other clusters and grammatical constructions as well (as in tryna, wanna etc). Here it's dropped and the vowel of to—which is usually a schwa [ə]—is linked with the preceding word; going to → gonna: [ˈɡəʊɪ̃ŋtə] → [ˈgə̃nə]\n\n* Deletion of the /g/: plosives (/g t d k/ etc) require great effort to articulate (the air is completely blocked and then released), so people dropped the plosive /g/ to make its articulation easier: [aɪ̃m gə̃nə] → [aɪ̃m ə̃nə] (i'm ana)\n\n* linking I'm and gonna: In causal and connected speech, consonants and vowels are often linked by a process called liaison, so both I'm and gonna join together and become [aɪ̃mə̃nə] (i'mana).\n\n* Syncope of the vowel in the second syllable: Unstressed schwas are often lost through syncope (for example, 'chocolate' is choc.late for most speakers). If we removed the schwa from the second syllable, we'd get [aɪmnə] (i'mna).\n\n* Deletion of /n/: It's simple cluster reduction. In English, two nasals that are next to each other are often reduced to a single nasal (as in damn), so the /n/ is deleted, yielding in this case [aɪ̃mə] (i'ma). Or people dropped the /n/ for the sake of ease.\n\nSome people further reduce the diphthong [aɪ] it to something like [a], which results in [ãmə] (ama)\nThat's why people spell it that way. It's highly informal and as TypeIA pointed out in a comment, it's mostly a verbal thing and is not usually found in written form. It's commonly found in chatspeak or lolspeak.

What do I do?\n\nQuestion: What is the best thing you can do to prevent yourself from getting sick when you travel to a Third World nation?\n\n\nA: Here's a more detailed response:\n\nTraveling to a Third World nation can be a great adventure, but it can also be a risk for you and your family. The risk is due to a variety of things, including poor sanitation, contaminated water, and poor hygiene. Here are some things you can do to help prevent yourself from getting sick when you travel:\n\n1. Properly cook food: This is one of the most important things you can do. Properly cooked food can reduce your risk of foodborne illness. Make sure to follow the cooking time and temperature guidelines for the food you are eating.\n\n2. Wash your hands frequently: Regularly wash your hands with soap and water, or use hand sanitizer if it is available. This is especially important when you are sick.\n\n3. Avoid raw meat: If you can't eat your food, don't eat it. Avoid raw meat, eggs, and poultry as they are all common sources of foodborne illness.\n\n4. Use bottled water: Bottled water is often safe to drink, but if you are traveling to a Third World nation, it is best to avoid drinking water from local sources. Instead, use bottled water or filtered water.\n\n5. Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water is important, but it is especially important if you are traveling to a Third World nation. Staying hydrated will help keep you feeling well.\n\n6. Stay in good health: If you do get sick while traveling, make sure to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Don't hesitate to take your medication with you, as you may not have access to medical care in the Third World nation.\n\n7. Stay safe: Traveling to a Third World nation can be exciting, but it can also be dangerous. Make sure to follow all the safety precautions that you can to help prevent yourself from getting sick.\n\nResponse: I can'",
    "response": "Basically, you can't.\nThe world is full of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, even in developed, First World nations. There are some decent steps to trying to minimize your exposure:\n\n* Properly cooked foods. Everything heated to a proper internal temperature (depends on the dish, check the USDA's site for guidelines), no sampling the raw chicken dish, etc.\n* For fruits and veg, if you can't peel it, don't eat it. A tremendous number of GI outbreaks are due to fruit and veg, rather than meat. This includes things like salads - since you can't really peel lettuce, avoid it.\n* Check if the local water is safe. When in doubt, assume it isn't. You can stick to bottled water, though there's always the distinct chance its being bottled from a contaminated source. Coke/Pepsi etc., and beer are good alternatives. Little known fact, the Coca-Cola company is hugely involved in clean water programs worldwide, because they need it for their product.\n* Ice. Ice is bad. Its probably made using the local tap-water, and there are many beasties that can survive an encounter with an ice machine.\n\nBut when it comes down to it, nearly every traveller makes some sort of safe-eating \"mistake\" fairly frequently, whether they realize it or not. At the end of the day, your best bet is to talk to your travel physician, and see if you can get a prescription for an antibiotic. Using that in combination with something like Imodium will probably keep your trip mostly on track - shutting down the problem long enough for the antibiotics to treat the source. Unless of course its viral - norovirus, rotavirus etc. In that event, best of luck.\nAnd if it does happen? Stay hydrated. You're losing salts and water, they need to be replaced."

Since this is your first job, he most likely hired you because he saw the potential to become a good coder in you. So if you really want to impress him, learn. Learn the language, learn the system you're working on, learn the ins and outs and dark corners. Focus on learning correct principles, learning them well and learning them quickly, in that order.\nAnd remember that part of learning is copying knowledge that other people already have. Don't be afraid to ask questions, either of your coworkers or on StackOverflow, or research things on Google. Whatever you do, don't pretend you know something when you really don't, in an effort to avoid seeming dumb. Any good developer will notice quickly, and that will make you look even stupider in their eyes.

    "response": "Simple answer\nPixel shaders are tiny programs that can do operations on a single pixel on the screen, as opposed to geometry shaders and vertex shaders which work on the geometrical primitives (triangles) that make up everything you see on the screen. The most common use for pixel shaders is 'shading', approximation to real world lighting. Commonly used shading model is Phong.\nPixel shaders are executed on your video card, so your video card needs to support them. Each new version provides more capabilities, so an older video card will not run newer shaders. A new version of the pixel shader specification (e.g. Pixel Shader 3.0) is usually released for each new version of DirectX (more accurately, Direct3D).\nSoftware Requirements\nYou need to have the correct version of Direct3D (or OpenGL) installed in order to use the shaders. For example, Pixel Shader 4.0 requires at least Direct3D 10. Normally you don't have to worry about this, every game that uses Direct3D will install the correct version for you when you install the game. The only exceptions are Direct3D 10 and later, which will not run on Windows XP or earlier. You will need at least Windows Vista in order to play a game that uses Direct3D 10 or 11.\nWikipedia provides a nice list of Pixel Shader versions, the version of Direct3D you need, and the types of graphics cards that work with them.\n\nTechnical answer\nThe 'standard' stages of a 3D rendering pipeline are as follows (somewhat simplified):\n\n* Transformation (Moving, rotating and scaling all the objects in the scene)\n* Lighting\n* Projection ('Squashing' the 3D world into a 2D plane)\n* Clipping (Removing anything outside the field of view)\n* Rasterising (Converting the vector graphics (triangles, etc) into raster graphics (pixels))\n* Texturing\n* Display\n\nPixel Shaders are used as an alternative to the standard texturing phase. During rasterisation, each triangle is converted into pixels. These pixels do not have their final colour yet, but the do have a bunch of parameters associated with them. These include base colour, texture coordinates, lighting information, etc. The Pixel Shader is a small program that takes these parameters and uses them to calculate the final colour as it is displayed on the screen. The Pixel Shader has access to all texture data, and can use them to do interesting things such as blending two textures (to create a 'dirty' look), using a texture as a bump map (to simulate a relief), or to simulate reflections.\nHardware\nOn the hardware side, Pixel Shaders are executed on 'Shader Units', small processors on your GPU. Each Shader Unit is basically a very simple CPU, but a modern video card may contain thousands of these things (an AMD Radeon HD6990 contains over 3000). Older GPUs had different Shader Units for different tasks: Pixel Shaders were executed on different parts of the system than Vertex Shaders. Modern GPUs have so called 'unified shader units' which can perform all of these operations."

    "response": "Cohesion refers to what the class (or module) can do. Low cohesion would mean that the class does a great variety of actions - it is broad, unfocused on what it should do. High cohesion means that the class is focused on what it should be doing, i.e. only methods relating to the intention of the class.\nExample of Low Cohesion:\n```-------------------\n| Staff           |\n-------------------\n| checkEmail()    |\n| sendEmail()     |\n| emailValidate() |\n| PrintLetter()   |\n-------------------\n```\nExample of High Cohesion:\n```----------------------------\n| Staff                   |\n----------------------------\n| -salary                 |\n| -emailAddr              |\n----------------------------\n| setSalary(newSalary)    |\n| getSalary()             |\n| setEmailAddr(newEmail)  |\n| getEmailAddr()          |\n----------------------------\n```\nAs for coupling, it refers to how related or dependent two classes/modules are toward each other. For low coupled classes, changing something major in one class should not affect the other. High coupling would make it difficult to change and maintain your code; since classes are closely knit together, making a change could require an entire system revamp.\nGood software design has ***high cohesion*** and ***low coupling***."

(Useful in UI frameworks where the UI thread is where you are supposed to mess with UI elements)\nWe have two signatures we are considering:\n```std::future run_in_ui_thread( std::function ) // (A)\nstd::future run_in_ui_thread( std::function const& ) // (B)\n```\n\nNow, we are likely to use these as follows:\n```run_in_ui_thread( [=]{\n  // code goes here\n} ).wait();\n```\nwhich will create an anonymous closure (a lambda), construct a ```std::function``` out of it, pass it to the ```run_in_ui_thread``` function, then wait for it to finish running in the main thread.\nIn case (A), the ```std::function``` is directly constructed from our lambda, which is then used within the ```run_in_ui_thread```.  The lambda is ```move```d into the ```std::function```, so any movable state is efficiently carried into it.\nIn the second case, a temporary ```std::function``` is created, the lambda is ```move```d into it, then that temporary ```std::function``` is used by reference within the ```run_in_ui_thread```.\nSo far, so good -- the two of them perform identically.  Except the ```run_in_ui_thread``` is going to make a copy of its function argument to send to the ui thread to execute! (it will return before it is done with it, so it cannot just use a reference to it).  For case (A), we simply ```move``` the ```std::function``` into its long-term storage.  In case (B), we are forced to copy the ```std::function```.\nThat store makes passing by value more optimal.  If there is any possibility you are storing a copy of the ```std::function```, pass by value.  Otherwise, either way is roughly equivalent: the only downside to by-value is if you are taking the same bulky ```std::function``` and having one sub method after another use it.  Barring that, a ```move``` will be as efficient as a ```const&```.\nNow, there are some other differences between the two that mostly kick in if we have persistent state within the ```std::function```.\nAssume that the ```std::function``` stores some object with a ```operator() const```, but it also has some ```mutable``` data members which it modifies (how rude!).\nIn the ```std::function const&``` case, the ```mutable``` data members modified will propagate out of the function call.  In the ```std::function``` case, they won't.\nThis is a relatively strange corner case.\nYou want to treat ```std::function``` like you would any other possibly heavy-weight, cheaply movable type.  Moving is cheap, copying can be expensive."

    "generated_instruction": "Can you explain to me how the Relation object works in Laravel and how to use the methods ```exists()``` and ```count()``` on it?\n\nResponse: Sure, I'd like to explain how the Relation object works in Laravel and how you can use the methods ```exists()``` and ```count()``` on it.\n\nLaravel uses magic property getters to create function calls on relation objects. For example, the following code:\n```$model->relation()->exists()``` will run the query ```SELECT count(*) FROM `relations` WHERE `id` = 1``` and return a boolean value. This is because the ```->relation()``` method is a function call.\nThe same is true for the method ```count()``` which will run the query ```SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `relations` WHERE `id` = 1``` and return the number of rows.\nBoth of these methods are faster than running the query on the entire model directly because they only run a single query to retrieve the count of the related rows.\n\nThe reason for this is because Eloquent queries are cached, and the Eloquent query Builder is set up to only select the related objects. That Builder in turn passes unknown method calls through to its underlying query Builder, which means that it only selects the related objects and returns the results. This means that the Eloquent query Builder is set up to only select the related objects, so it can pass unknown method calls through to the underlying query Builder, which then passes those unknown method calls through to the underlying query Builder, which passes them to the underlying query Builder, which passes them to the underlying query Builder, and so on until the query is executed.\n\nIn summary, the Relation object passes unknown method calls through to an Eloquent query Builder, which is set up to only select the related objects. That Builder in turn passes unknown method calls through to its underlying query Builder, which is set up to only select the related objects. This means you can use the ```exists()``` and ```count()``` methods directly from a relation object, without needing to call the underlying query Builder.\n\nNote that the ```exists()``` and ```count()``` methods are not guaranteed to be faster than calling the underlying query Builder directly. The query Builder is a lazy query builder, so it only selects the related objects when it needs to, so it is not guaranteed to be as fast as calling the underlying query Builder directly. However, if you are only using the relation object for accessing related data, and you are not doing any calculations on the data that the relation is related to, then calling the underlying query Builder directly can be much faster than using the relation object, especially if the data is not very large.\n\n\nResponse: Can you explain to me how the Relation object works in Laravel and how to use the methods ```exists()``` and ```count()``` on it?\n\nLaravel uses magic property getters to create function calls on relation objects. For example, the following code:\n```$model->relation()->exists()``` will run the query ```SELECT count(*) FROM `relations` WHERE `id` = 1``` and return a boolean value.

Likewise, using ```exists``` doesn't need to pull model data either.\nBoth ```exists()``` and ```count()``` work on all relation types I've tried, so at least ```belongsTo```, ```hasOne```, ```hasMany```, and ```belongsToMany```."

Web forms does a great job at hiding a lot of that complexity from the developer.\n* Rapid Application Development (RAD)\n•   The ability to just 'jump in' and start delivering web forms.  This is disputed by some of the MVC community, but pushed by Microsoft.  In the end, it comes down to the level of expertise of the developer and what they are comfortable with.  The web forms model probably has less of a learning curve to less experienced developers.\n* Larger control toolbox\n•   ASP.NET Web Forms offers a much greater and more robust toolbox (web controls) whereas MVC offers a more primitive control set relying more on rich client-side controls via jQuery (Javascript).\n* Mature\n•   It's been around since 2002 and there is an abundance of information with regards to questions, problems, etc.  Offers more third-party control - need to consider your existing toolkits.\n\nASP.NET MVC:\n\n* Separation of concerns (SoC)\n•   From a technical standpoint, the organization of code within MVC is very clean, organized and granular, making it easier (hopefully) for a web application to scale in terms of functionality.  Promotes great design from a development standpoint.\n* Easier integration with client side tools (rich user interface tools)\n•   More than ever, web applications are increasingly becoming as rich as the applications you see on your desktops.  With MVC, it gives you the ability to integrate with such toolkits (such as jQuery) with greater ease and more seamless than in Web Forms.\n* Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Friendly / Stateless\n•   URL's are more friendly to search engines (i.e.  mywebapplication.com/users/ 1 - retrieve user with an ID of 1 vs mywebapplication/users/getuser.aspx (id passed in session)).  Similarly, since MVC is stateless, this removes the headache of users who spawn multiple web browsers from the same window (session collisions).  Along those same lines, MVC adheres to the stateless web protocol rather than 'battling' against it.\n* Works well with developers who need high degree of control\n•   Many controls in ASP.NET web forms automatically generate much of the raw HTML you see when an page is rendered.  This can cause headaches for developers.  With MVC, it lends itself better towards having complete control with what is rendered and there are no surprises.  Even more important, is that the HTML forms typically are much smaller than the Web forms which can equate to a performance boost - something to seriously consider.\n* Test Driven Development (TDD)\n•   With MVC, you can more easily  create tests for the web side of things.  An additional layer of testing will provide yet another layer of defense against unexpected behavior.\n\nAuthentication, authorization, configuration, compilation and deployment are all features that are shared between the two web frameworks."

    "generated_instruction": "The higher you go, the lower the density of the air becomes. This lower density results in a lower lift being generated for the same airspeed and angle of attack. Effectively, the higher you fly the lower your minimum speed becomes. So while climbing, your speed needs to increase to compensate for the lower air density.

    "response": "The higher you get, the lower the density of the air becomes. This lower density results in a lower lift being generated for the same airspeed and angle of attack. Effectively, the higher you fly the higher your minimum speed becomes. So while climbing, your speed needs to increase to compensate for the lower air density. As long a you can fly faster, the lower density at altitude can be compensated for. \nBasically there are two things that limit your maximum speed: thrust and speed of sound and with that your maximum altitude.\nFirst is thrust; the higher you get, the lower the thrust your engines deliver. You might note that drag goes down with the air density as well but since you are flying faster and faster during the climb the drag doesn't decrease at all. If your maximum altitude is limited by thrust then at some point during the climb the thrust and drag are getting close to equal and that is where the climb stops. When you can no longer climb with more than 100ft per minute (for propeller aircraft) or 500ft per minute (for jet / turbofan aircraft) you have reached your service ceiling. If the aircraft maximum altitude is determined by thrust, the absolute ceiling will take very long to reach. \nAt high altitudes air breathing engines will get difficulties eventually. Due to the lower air density the mass flow through the engine is reduced up to a point where it causes a flame out. \nThe other limitation is the speed of sound, at least for subsonic aircraft. In the process of generating lift, air flowing over the top of the wing is accelerated. At one point, when the aircraft is still flying below the speed of sound, shock waves will start to form over the wing. This results in increase of drag and reduces the lift. So provided you have enough engine power at your disposal you can climb to an altitude where your minimum speed is also your maximum speed. This is called the coffin corner. In the coffin corner:\n\n* if you fly any faster, you will exceed the maximum Mach number ($M_{mo}$) of your aircraft, resulting in high speed buffet, vibrations and possible loss of control. \n* if you fly any slower, the maximum lift that the wing can provide will be insufficient to maintain altitude. Descent or the aircraft will stall. \n* if you fly any higher and you will be too fast and too slow at the same time. \n* if you turn, you increase the wing loading, thereby increasing the minimum speed needed to create the required lift. Also the outer wing will easily exceed the maximum speed while at the same time the inner wing is below stall speed. This can quickly develop into a spin. \n\nSince accurate knowledge of engine performance, drag and wing characteristics of the aircraft is needed, there is not a simple formula to derive the maximum altitude for an aircraft.  \n\nApart from the aircraft performance related limitations above there is a certified maximum operating altitude for the pressurized cabin. This takes into account the structural properties of the hull (pressure difference between inside and outside) and the achievable emergency descent rate in case of a depressurization event."

Also, it appears to be Dynamically Typed, if typed at all.  So we need to see what Typing means.\n\nTyped means that the language distinguishes between different types such as string, number, boolean, object, array, null, undefined and so on. Also each operation is bound to specific types. So you cannot divide an integer by a string.\n```    2 / \"blah\"  // produces NaN\n```\nUntyped means the operation of dividing integer by string would result in treating the first four bytes of string as integer.  This is because Untyped operations take place directly on bits, there are no types to observe.  The outcome will be something quite unexpected:\n```    2 / \"blah\"  // will be treated as  2 / 1500275048\n```\nSince JavaScript behaves according to the definition of being Typed, it must be.

For example ```year, month, day = date()``` will raise a lint warning if ```day``` is not used later in the code. The fix, if ```day``` is truly not needed, is to write ```year, month, _ = date()```. Same with lambda functions, ```lambda arg: 1.0``` creates a function requiring one argument but not using it, which will be caught by lint. The fix is to write ```lambda _: 1.0```. An unused variable is often hiding a bug/typo (e.g. set ```day``` but use ```dya``` in the next line).\n\nThe pattern matching feature added in Python 3.10 elevated this usage from &quot;convention&quot; to &quot;language syntax&quot; where ```match``` statements are concerned: in match cases, ```_``` is a wildcard pattern, and the runtime doesn't even bind a value to the symbol in that case.\n\nFor other use cases, remember that ```_``` is still a valid variable name, and hence will still keep objects alive. In cases where this is undesirable (e.g. to release memory or external resources) an explicit ```del name``` call will both satisfy linters that the name is being used, and promptly clear the reference to the object."

The construction is used to indicate that a past action has been completed, and it's used in a variety of ways depending on the language.\n\nFor example, in French, the have-perfective construction is used to indicate that something has been written, as in \"I have written a letter.\" In Italian, the construction is used to indicate that something has been eaten, as in \"I have eaten a pie.\" In Spanish, the construction is used to indicate that something has been paid, as in \"I have paid the bill.\"\n\nThe have-perfective construction is also used in Germanic languages, and it has been adopted into many other languages within the Standard Average European (SAE) Sprachbund. For example, in English, the construction is used to indicate that something has been done, as in \"I have accomplished this task.\" In Dutch, the construction is used to indicate that something has been seen, as in \"I have seen the rain.\"\n\nSo the have-perfective construction is a feature that has spread through the area of influence of the SAE Sprachbund and has been adopted into many other languages within the same area.\n\n\n\nA: This is a feature that is shared by many languages within the Standard Average European (SAE) Sprachbund, which is a set of languages spoken in Western Europe.

In particular, this one is a feature of the \"Standard Average European\" Sprachbund, a group of languages centered in Western Europe, and it's one of the features that was originally used to define that Sprachbund in the first place!\n\nThe construction seems to have arisen back in Latin. In Classical Latin, past aoristic verbs (\"I loved\") and present perfective verbs (\"I have loved\") look exactly the same: both of those would be written amāvī. But it's a pretty useful distinction to be able to make! So in Vulgar Latin, a new construction arose, using the verb habēre (\"to have\"). It's thought that a phrase like habeō litterās scriptās \"I have (written letters)\" got reanalyzed into \"I (have written) letters\", with habēre no longer indicating that you're actually holding anything in your hands, just that an action's been completed in the past.\n\nVulgar Latin eventually evolved into French, Italian, Spanish, and all the other Romance languages, and brought this construction with it; habēre is the direct ancestor of French avoir, via a series of sound changes. And once various Romance languages and Germanic languages and others were all being spoken in the same area, this feature spread through the Sprachbund: people speaking Germanic languages started to use the same construction. English \"have\"/German haben/etc isn't actually at all related to Latin habēre, but they looked similar, so it was the obvious choice when adopting the construction into Germanic.\n\nNowadays, this feature is called the \"have-perfective\", and it shows up in all sorts of languages within the Standard Average European (SAE) Sprachbund. It's not at all universal, but can be a good way to determine if a language has been influenced by SAE or not!"

And even then, only the variables themselves (the names that refer to objects) are local to the function; objects themselves are always global, and anything can refer to them. The `Thread` object for a particular thread is not a special object in this regard. If you store the `Thread` object somewhere all threads can access (like a global variable) then all threads can access that one Thread object. If you want to atomically modify anything that another thread has access to, you have to protect it with a lock. And all threads must of course share this very same lock, or it wouldn't be very effective.\n\nIf you want actual thread-local storage, that's where `threading.local` comes in. Attributes of `threading.local` are not shared between threads; each thread sees only the attributes it itself placed in there.

    "response": "People are resources, dictators (and oppressive regimes in general) don't want them to defect to other countries because they want them working for their regime. Some of them are going to be people that the regime has put their resources into, like scientists and doctors, but even laborers are valuable for actually gathering and assembling the resources the regime needs. Additionally, the regime especially does not want people with access to sensitive information to defect to their enemies. That isn't just spies and soldiers, there are plenty of \"regular\" government positions that require access to something the regime would not want falling into enemy hands, like economic data that could be used for propaganda. Obviously this is true of any country, and even in democracies with strong human rights records, people with access to classified information are usually required to submit to strict scrutiny of their international travel. Given that they aren't concerned with human rights, dictatorships can take the easier option of restricting travel to any citizens.\nHowever, defection is really a piece of a bigger issue - oppressive regimes maintain their rule in part by controlling information. Here's an interesting article that talks about how dictatorships keep power. Jerrold Post, director of the political psychology program at George Washington University, is referenced:\n\n  Post said that in both Iraq and North Korea, dictators tightly controlled the flow of information. That control was upended in the past two years during the \"Arab spring\" revolts that swept away despots in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and some of the Gulf states, revolts that were encouraged in large part by information spread by cell phones and social media. \n\nNorth Korea is probably the most extreme example of information control (according to Reporters without Borders, they are dead last in Press Freedom in the world), but this can be seen in other oppressive regimes - for example, China attempts to limit access to \"wrong\" information via its Great Firewall. This is thrown out the window if citizens go somewhere with free media and realize they are being lied to. Traveling can be the cause of their dissension, rather than a symptom.\nKnown dissidents may also be restricted from traveling so that they can not coordinate with foreign countries or anti-dictatorship organizations, and to prevent them from smuggling contraband or evidence of the regime's misinformation back into the country. Regimes can control the information originating in their country, but once someone is outside their borders the regime cannot control who they speak with."

The fuel is mixed with air and ignited by a spark plug. The reaction produces a large amount of energy, which is used to move the pistons in the engine. The energy is then released through the exhaust port, which emits the water (or steam) that comes out of the tailpipe.\n\nThis water is a natural occurrence of the combustion process and is usually not a problem. However, if the water is not completely removed from the engine, it can cause problems, such as a leaking catalytic convertor, which can lead to emissions issues and damage to the engine. To avoid this, the catalytic convertor in the exhaust system is designed to help clean up the water and other pollutants that may be released into the exhaust stream. This is done by using a special coating on the catalytic converter, which helps to reduce the amount of water and other pollutants that are released into the exhaust stream.\n\nIn summary, a gasoline engine works by burning a fuel (such as gasoline) and producing a combustion reaction.

Here is the reason why:\n\nA gasoline (petrol) molecule is made up as such:\n\nC8H18 (or 8 Carbon atoms and 18 Hydrogen atoms)\n\nEnergy is obtained from the combustion of it by the conversion of a hydrocarbon to carbon dioxide and water. The combustion of octane follows this reaction:\n\n  2 C8H18 + 25 O2 → 16 CO2 + 18 H2O\n\nOr better said, you have two of the hydrocarbon molecules along with 25 oxygen molecules, they swirl together into a mix, the spark plug ignites them, boom, and out the tail pipe comes 16 carbon dioxide molecules and 18 water molecules ... at least in a perfect world. Some cars don't put out exactly that ratio. There may be a little bit of carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbons (C8H18), and/or nitrogen oxide (NO2) coming out of the engine exhaust port along with the CO2 and H2O. In this case, the catalytic convertor's job is to help clean these up so you can get closer to the perfect ratio described above.\n\nAs described, the water coming out of the tail pipe is a natural occurrence of the combustion process. You will usually see it coming out of the tail pipe when the engine and exhaust system of the vehicle is not completely warmed up. When it does become completely warmed up, you won't see it any more, because it comes out as steam (well, you'll see it in the winter time if it's cold enough, but you get the idea). "

An IP address could not be used as it would be interpreted as an unqualified domain name, which cannot be resolved.\n\nThe reasons for this in the 1980s, when the specs were originally written, are almost the same as the reasons for it today: A host may be connected to multiple networks and use multiple protocols.\n\nBack in the 80s, it was not uncommon to have mail gateways which connected both to the (relatively new) Internet which used TCP/IP and to other legacy networks, which often used other protocols. Specifying MX in this way allowed for DNS records which could identify how to reach such a host on a network other than the Internet, such as Chaosnet. In practice, though, this almost never happened; virtually everyone re-engineered their networks to become part of the Internet instead.\n\nToday, the situation is that a host may be reached by multiple protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) and by multiple IP addresses in each protocol.

    "response": "Can you? Absolutely, and air traffic control will treat you (almost) like any other airplane. You are supposedly handled on a first-come-first-serve basis (reality is slightly different with different aircraft speeds, etc.). Do the airlines like it if you slow them down?  No, but it's part of the system and the way that it works.\n\nVery often, there are multiple runways at bigger airports, and sometimes there are even shorter runways that are dedicated for airplanes that don't need to land on the same one as the \"big boys\". Even if not, they will work you in.\n\nNow, that being said, very often there is a better option. As you said, there are usually high fees at the big airports, so landing at a smaller satellite airport can often save you money and save you time because you won't have to taxi as far or sit and wait in line to get out. An extra 15 minutes by car can be better than an extra 30 minutes while taxiing. \n\nAs far as being prepared, it isn't really much different than smaller airports other than the fact that ATC is much busier. They don't have the time/tolerance to keep repeating instructions to you, and expect you to be \"on your game\". When they rattle off taxi instructions like \"Cessna N1234, taxi to the ramp via Alpha, Tango, Echo, and Xray. Hold short of runway 23.\" they expect a quick readback and for you to follow instructions exactly because they need to move on to the next guy. \n\nIt will also help everyone out if you don't fly your final approach the way that most people are taught for an entire 10 mile final: very close to your actual landing speed. In fact, you are usually landing on a runway that is 4X+ the distance that you need and you can slow down fairly quickly (especially compared to a jet), so if you can fly an extra 20 (or 80) knots as long as possible, it will be greatly appreciated and keep traffic moving. Make sure that you leave yourself enough time to slow down at the end and above all else, ***be safe***."

So since you passed ```await``` an array (of Promise objects) here instead of a Promise, the value returned by await is simply that array, which is of type ```Promise[]```.\nWhat you probably want to do is call ```Promise.all``` on the array returned by ```map``` in order to convert it to a single Promise before ```await```ing it.\nAccording to the MDN docs for ```Promise.all```:\n\nThe ```Promise.all(iterable)``` method returns a promise that resolves\nwhen all of the promises in the iterable argument have resolved, or\nrejects with the reason of the first passed promise that rejects.\n\nSo in your case:\n```var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nvar results: number[] = await Promise.all(arr.map(async (item): Promise => {\n    await callAsynchronousOperation(item);\n    return item + 1;\n}));\n```\nThis will resolve the specific error you are encountering here.\nDepending on exactly what it is you're trying to do you may also consider using ```Promise.allSettled```, ```Promise.any```, or ```Promise.race``` instead of ```Promise.all```, though in most situations (almost certainly including this one) ```Promise.all``` will be the one you want."

However, you don't get a torque from spinning a reaction wheel at constant angular velocity but by changing and accelerating that angular velocity.\n\nNow the torque imparted on the helicopter by the air through the main rotor is steady - or at least its of roughly constant direction. Therefore, to counter that torque, the reaction wheel would have to accelerated uniformly and indefinitely. Clearly this is impossible from an engineering standpoint.\n\nYou can also think of this from a conservation of angular momentum, without thinking about the origin of the torques. The air imparts a steady angular impulse to the helicopter. Therefore, the helicopter system's angular momentum must increase steadily (unless there's a countering torque from the tailfan). So either that angular momentum is the spinning of the helicopter's body (which is what we're trying to avoid) or that of the reaction wheel, whose angular momentum must be steadily increasing under the action of the angular impulse to the system."

Since even day scripts would never run on the 31st day of longer months, you don't lose anything using 30 days as the base for even-days, and by specifying specifically to divide it up as if there were 31 days you can force odd-day execution.\n\nThe syntax would look like this:\n```# Will only run on odd days:\n0 0 1-31/2 * * command\n# Will only run on even days:\n0 0 2-30/2 * * command\n```\n\nYour concern about months not having the same number of days is not important here because no months have MORE days than this, and for poor February, the date range just won't ever match the last day or two, but it will do no harm having it listed.\n\nThe only 'gotcha' for this approach is that if you are on an odd day cycle, following months with 31 days your command will also run on the first of the month. Likewise if you are forcing an even cycle, each leap year will cause one three-day cycle at the end of February. You cannot really get around the fact that any regular pattern of \"every other day\" is not always going to fall on even or odd days in every month and any way you force this you will either have an extra run or be missing a run between months with mismatched day counts."

Can you explain to me what vocabulary learning is, and how it differs from using only one strategy?\n\nResponse: That's a good start!\n\nVocabulary learning is the process of building up a vocabulary, which is a set of words that you know and can use in context. The process of vocabulary learning is a combination of a few different strategies:\n\n1. Fluency - Using the words you know in context to understand what they mean.\n2. Contextual meaning - Understanding the context in which a word is used to help you see how it is used in context.\n3. Knowledge - Using the words you know to build up a broader understanding of vocabulary and to help you see how words are related to each other.\n\nUsing only one strategy is probably the least efficient way to learn vocabulary. This is because every strategy has certain strengths and weaknesses. For example, using only contextual meaning will only help you understand the meaning of a word, but it won't help you see how it is used in context. On the other hand, using only knowledge will help you see how words are related, but it won't help you understand the context in which they are used.\n\nUsing flashcards can be helpful, but it's not a comprehensive way to learn vocabulary. Flashcards are designed to show you the meaning of a word, but they don't show you how the word is used in context. Flashcards are also usually only for single words, so they don't help you see how words are related to each other.\n\nUsing only one strategy is also not a good way to learn vocabulary, because it will only help you understand the meaning of a word, but it won't help you see how the word is used in context.\n\nOne way of learning vocabulary is by combining different strategies that will help you see how the word is used in context, show you the variety of meanings it can have, and see what collocations it has. This can be done by reading examples of the word and writing your own sample sentences, using contextual meaning to understand the meaning of the word, and using knowledge to see how the word is related to other words. Another important thing is to be exposed to the word in natural settings - so it's important to read a lot so that you'll encounter the words you've learnt naturally.\n\nResponse: I'm trying to learn a language, and I'm struggling to grasp the concept of vocabulary learning.

It also ignores the contextual subtleties of the word, and the knowledge is not always retained long-term. \n\nIt's best to combine flashcards with other strategies that will help you see how the word is used in context, show you the variety of meanings it can have (and doesn't have), see what collocations the word has, etc. One way of doing this is by reading examples of the word and writing your own sample sentences. Another important thing is to be exposed to the word in natural settings - so it's important to read a lot so that you'll encounter the words you've learnt naturally."

    "original_instruction": "Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20°C without risking my life?\n\nThe backstory\nFrom the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)\nI do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from \"civilisation\". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.\nHowever: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20°C (-4°F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?\nI do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.",

    "response": "Yes, it is definitely doable. -20&deg;C is only -4&deg;F. The real question is whether it is doable by you at the level of discomfort and hassle you are willing to put up with. Only you can answer that. At best we can point out what the hassles and discomforts will be.\n\nFirst, your fear of dying of cold in your sleep is silly. You'd have to do something pretty stupid to die of hypothermia, and even that's not going to happen when you're inside the sleeping bag. The main danger will be from frostbite, but that again would largely need stupidity to help it along, although that's easier to do than outright death from hypothermia.\n\nYour tent will be a long term fixed installation you set up once at a time and conditions of your choosing. You can therefore afford a larger and heavier tent with more stuff you bring in once. Definitely get a tent you can stand upright in. That will make changing clothes much quicker and more comfortable. Since you should be able to keep water out of the tent, get a nice down sleeping bag and a few light blankets. The down bag should be rated for most nights, then put the blankets on top for the few unusually cold nights. Since again weight is not really a issue, get a full sleeping bag, not a mummy bag. They are simply more comfortable. Get a good insulating pad, and another two as backup. Get a tent large enough to fit your sleeping bag and something to sit on next to it, like a folding chair. Put something under the legs to spread out the weight to that they don't hurt the tent floor. Get one of those rubber-backed mats people sometimes put just inside their doors and put it just inside your tent. That allows a place to step with boots still on, then you can sit down on the chair with boots still on the mat to take them off. The crud stays on the mat, which you can shake clean by reaching outside after having put on your down hut booties.\n\nSome things are going to be a hassle. At -4&deg;F you want to keep your gloves on whenever possible, but some tasks will be difficult that way. You end up taking your gloves on and off a lot, trading off efficiency with cold fingers. Get a pair of polypro glove liners. They are thin and still allow many tasks to be done, but provide at least a little insulation. Their main advantage is that any metal you touch won't immediately conduct the heet from your hand away. Touching bare metal at -4&deg;F is a good way to get frostbite.\n\nBe prepared for some discomfort no matter what equipment you have. The toughest part will be getting yourself out of the sleeping bag in the morning. You'll really have to will yourself to leave the warm comfort of the bag and get into the air at probably the coldest part of the day. At some point you'll have to change your clothes and get undressed in the process. That's going to be cold. It won't be cold long enough to be any real danger, so it's really a mindset issue to get over. Whether you can or not and are willing to push yourself in that way only you can say.\n\nYou say you have access to heated buildings during the day, so it would make things a lot simpler for you if you don't have to deal with cooking and eating at your camp. Perparing food outside in the cold takes a lot longer than in a heated kitchen, severly limits what you can do, and may also risk predator encounters depending on what is around your area in the winter."

    "generated_instruction": "The units named by Latimer Clark in his 1861 paper are: ohm (named after the Austrian physicist Michael Faraday), volt (named after the English physicist Michael Faraday), and farad (named after the French physicist André-Marie Ampère). Clark's name was used to introduce the units to the scientific community. The name farad was chosen by the International Electrical Congress in Paris in 1881.\n\nResponse: What name was given to the units that were introduced by Latimer Clark?\n\nWhere did Clark's name come from and how did the units get introduced?",
    "response": "The volt, ohm and farad were introduced by the same person, Latimer Clark, a cable engineer, in a paper in 1861. He started the tradition of naming units after scientists. He initially distorted all names: the unit names ohma, volt, galvat (from Galvani), and farad (from Faraday). In his words, he \"neglected etymological rules\". \n\nIn that same year, a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science began developing a coherent system of electrical units, the cgs system. Varley, a committee member, liked Clark's proposal, but he advocated adding a French name such as Ampere, to facilitate the international acceptance of the new units (\"I should like to introduce a French name into the list. We have Germany, England and Italy represented\"). For the same reason he may have pleaded for not distorting the French and German names. In addition, Varley objected to the galvat \"because Galvani discovered next to nothing\".\n\nLatimer Clark adapted the unit names in his 'Elementary treatise on electrical measurement' (1868). He changed ohma to ohm, and dropped the galvat. Maxwell acknowledged Clark's practical units and their names in his 'Treatise on electricity and magnetism' (1873). In 1881, at the International Electrical Congress in Paris), two French names, ampere and coulomb, were added. The diplomacy worked, and the new system of electrical units was adopted by all countries. The only units that kept the initial name distortion were the volt and the farad."

Why does that force have to be a cross product of two vectors?\nIs it possible to come up with them when what we do is just observe the nature?",
    "generated_instruction": "What is the reason for the existence of the dot and cross products in mathematics?\n\nResponse: What is the reason for the existence of the dot and cross products in mathematics?\n\n\n\nA: \n\n\n\nThe dot and cross products are the two most important algebraically independent ways to multiply two vectors together in a vector space. These two operations are related by the symmetry of the orthogonal group, which is the group of rotations that leave all vectors invariant.\n\nThe dot product is the most common and well-known of the two, since it is the fundamental way of multiplying vectors in any field. The cross product, on the other hand, is less commonly used, but it is used in many contexts where the dot product is not applicable, such as in the study of rotations.\n\nThe reason for the existence of the dot and cross products is that they are algebraically independent and can be expressed as linear combinations of the dot product and the cross product. This means that any physically useful method for combining physical quantities like vectors together should be isotropic, which is why they are the only two possible multilinear operations.\n\nThe laws of physics appear to be isotropic, which makes the use of the dot and cross products inevitable. Since the laws of physics appear to be isotropic, it makes sense that any physically useful method for combining physical quantities like vectors together should be isotropic as well.\n\nThe dot and cross products are used in many different contexts, but their fundamental importance lies in their role in the study of rotations. They are used in fields such as mechanics, geometry, and algebra to solve problems related to rotations, such as the determination of the length of a vector after it has been rotated by an angle.\n\nIn conclusion, the dot and cross products are the most important and well-known algebraically independent ways of multiplying two vectors in a vector space, and they are used in many different contexts where they are necessary. They are also the foundation of the study of rotations, which is an important and important field in mathematics and physics.\n\n\nA: \n\n\n\nThe dot product and cross product are two ways to multiply two vectors together in a vector space.

    "response": "This is a great question. The dot and cross products seem very mysterious when they are first introduced to a new student. For example, why does the scalar (dot) product have a cosine in it and the vector (cross) product have a sine, rather than vice versa? And why do these same two very non-obvious ways of \"multiplying\" vectors together arise in so many different contexts?\n\nThe fundamental answer (which unfortunately may not be very accessible if you're a new student) is that there are only two algebraically independent tensors that are invariant under arbitrary rotations in $n$ dimensions (we say that they are \"$\\mathrm{SO}(n)$ invariant\"). These are the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{ij}$ and the Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{ijk \\cdots}$. Contracting two vectors with these symbols yields the dot and cross products, respectively (the latter only works in three dimensions). Since the laws of physics appear to be isotropic (i.e. rotationally invariant), it makes sense that any physically useful method for combining physical quantities like vectors together should be isotropic as well. The dot and cross products turn out to be the only two possible multilinear options.\n\nWhy multilinear maps are so useful in physics is an even deeper and more fundamental question, but which answers to that question are satisfying is probably inherently a matter of opinion."

    "response": "The walk cycle is considered to be one of the most basic aspects of animation. American animators and animation enthusiasts often times scorn the Japanese styles and methods of animation as lazy, while Japanese anime enthusiasts deride the American style as clunky or too comical.\n\nWhy is that you ask? The answer lies in how these countries distribute their budget and time. \n\nWhile American animation often times may seem lacking in it's attention to detail, it makes up for it the quality of their animation. American animation often times meticulous and original in how they animate motion, though sometimes content is reused cyclically, the animation is painstakingly frame by frame. \n\nIn contrast, Japanese anime uses a lot of shortcuts (to save budget and meet deadlines). Typically long scenes feature only the mouth of a character (and maybe other minor features like a waving hair or glittering eyes) moving during delivery of key information/dialog, or the short burst of motion of some character in some an action pose against an animated, cyclic, and stylized background (I'm looking at you transformation scenes). Often times these uses of dramatic still-shots are done against patterned (or static illustrated) backgrounds, sometimes a few moving emotive icons (sweat drops, question marks, small chibi animated heads) will accompany a some sort of monologue. Admittedly both styles of animation reuse shots and sequences, but it's more noticeable in Japanese anime for various reason (e.g., not enough budget and/or manpower). This is why Japanese anime is typically labeled as \"lazy\" by American animators and enthusiasts.\n\nA typical walk cycle in animation consists of 8 keyframes typically:\n\nThe smoothness of an animation is typically determined by the framerate and amount of key frames in the animation. \nIn American animation, the animation is captured by shooting two frames of film per drawing at a rate of 24 frames per second (fps) to achieve the smooth motion of American animation. \nJapanese anime, while it also runs at an average 24 fps, typically captures their animation at a rate of three or four frames per drawing in order to save money and manpower. Though it varies depending on the studio and tools used (e.g 3DCG) with main objects in the foreground (typically characters) are animated at 8 to 12 fps, while background objects can be animated at as low as 6 to 8 fps.\n\nLets compare the difference between one walk cycle that is 8 frame to one that is 16 frames, both at 60 fps:\n  \nNotice the 16 frame one is smoother, but slower while the 8 frame is faster, but choppier. This is because it takes the 16 frame animation twice as long, covering more frames, to go through one cycle than the 8 frame one.\nThe varying of frame rates can also be be used to depict the expansion and compression of time (think bullet time from The Matrix). However generally choppy animation is the result of not enough keyframes in your animation. More frames mean more and manpower and/or time, which ultimately means more money is required. Japanese anime production don't typically have as big of a budget compared to American productions (but there are exceptions), so they must make do with what they have and cut corners where they can (like Shaft did with the certain Bakemonogatari TV episodes)."

    "response": "Faulty Premise #1: John the Baptist was a reincarnation of Elijah\n\nWhen Jesus asked Peter who people said he was, he answered that some people thought that Jesus was Elijah come back. Peter knew better and said Jesus was the Christ. In any event, John the Baptist himself directly denied the claim (see John 1:19-21). \nWhat Jesus more likely was saying in Matthew 11 is that John the Baptist was a prophet in the tradition of Elijah. Elijah was the greatest of the prophets (even if his disciple Elisha inherited a double portion of his spirit). All of the prophets that followed came in the name and spirit of Elijah, in the same way that some of Paul's letters apparently were created after his death. They were in the spirit and tradition even if not the actual man. \nNote also Elijah never died - he was taken up into heaven, and people thought he would return. As such, no Elijah was not being thought to have reincarnated- only returned. Elijah's return was long a part of Jewish custom. Even today, during a Passover sedar, a chair is left empty for Elijah. But again, since he did not die, Jews look for his return, not his reincarnation. \n\nFaulty Premise #2: The Jewish world view has  any concept of reincarnation at all\n\nThe most basic rule of hermeneutics suggests that a text cannot mean what it could not mean to the original audience. If the Jews had no concept of reincarnation, then any interpretation that says it does has a very, very high bar to clear.\nIn his book The Gift of the Jews, Thomas Cahill advances the thesis that the primary distinctive philosophy of the Jews was precisely that history was not circular. Their linear idea of a human life was a departure from others and was an explicit rejection of reincarnation. As such, a text would need to be exceedingly explicit to a culture that rejected circular life patterns, and the obscure interpretation above (especially in light of the more obvious intepretation) simply doesn't hold water.\nFurthermore, the book of Hebrews - written to the people into which both Jesus and John the Baptist were born - explicitly reject reincarnation. As the writer points out in 9:27, \n\n  It is appointed unto a man once to die and then the judgement.\n\nHere we do have an explicit rejection of reincarnation by the followers of Jesus. There is one death. There is one judgement. Hence, in any Christian worldview, you don't come back."

    "response": "Although English historians have defined Reich as being a strictly German concept of sovereign rule, in the German language itself it means \"Empire\". In English, we speak of the Holy Roman Empire; in German, it is the HRR or \"Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation\". \n\nWiktionary quotes Busching, who in 1762 explained Reich as a German understanding of \"Eminence\", from the Latin Regnum, rather than an Empire or a Realm as other cultures would understand it. \n\nOne could see it as a word used in English, Russian, Portuguese and many other languages as a designation for any kind of German kingdom, empire or absolutism, similar to how one would address a foreigner according to their origin, e.g. Senor Martinez, Monsieur Aragon.\n\nCompare it to how many cultures, including the Germans, also use the word \"Commonwealth\" or \"Soviet Union\", despite the fact that Bavaria had formed its own Union of Soviets, the Räterepublik, during the Weimar Republic.\n\nIf you're interested in knowing when the word \"Third Reich\" came into usage, it is worth noting that during Fascist Germany, the country's official name was Das Deutsche Reich, and in the USA and UK it was usually referred to as Germany, Hitler's Germany, Berlin, Reich or, the most popular term, Nazi Germany. \n\n(Sources: Neville Chamberlain's declaration of war against Germany, headlines about Germany in newspapers like the NY Times or the Times, the Daily Mail's Lord Rothermere)\n\nIn Germany itself, the idea of a third Reich stemmed from the 19th century, where it was a popular philosophical theme in literature and theology. Writers like Johannes Schlaf, who wrote \"Das Dritte Reich\" in 1899, or the German translator of Ibsen's \"The Emperor and the Galilean\", popularized the idea of the imminent arrival of a thousand years of Christianity (a kind of positive apocalypse), which would follow a third \"Reich\". And they would quote Paul the Apostle and various saints, to make it clear that the third Reich would follow the heretic lex naturalis and the lex mosaica. \n\nNazi propagandists exploited this in their articles, making it sound as if the saints had had some sort of epiphany about Hitler and the Nazis.\n\nIn other words, the Third Reich began as an abstract idea of a Christian revolution, but was assumed by Nazi writers in order to bolster Hitler's popularity and justify the drastic and bloody decisions that the Fascist government was making.\n\nIn one of the earliest examples of the Third Reich being mentioned outside of Germany, Major Strasser in the film Casablanca talks about the Third Reich as if it was just the beginning to a kind of paradisaical future or of a fourth Reich.\n\nAfter 1945, the term was used exclusively to associate only to the unsuccessful reign of Fascism in Germany, and it ceased as a philosophical or theological idea in German literary circles."

    "response": "Dennis Ritchie’s paper on The Development of the C Language gives some idea of the reasoning behind this: namely, the fundamental rule in C that declaration syntax should match expression syntax\"\n\nFor each object of such a composed type, there was already a way to mention the underlying object: index the array, call the function, use the indirection operator on the pointer. Analogical reasoning led to a declaration syntax for names mirroring that of the expression syntax in which the names typically appear. Thus,\n```int i, *pi, **ppi;\n```\ndeclare an integer, a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a pointer to an integer. The syntax of these declarations reflects the observation that ```i```, ```*pi```, and ```**ppi``` all yield an ```int``` type when used in an expression. Similarly,\n```int f(), *f(), (*f)();\n```\ndeclare a function returning an integer, a function returning a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a function returning an integer;\n```int *api[10], (*pai)[10];\n```\ndeclare an array of pointers to integers, and a pointer to an array of integers. In all these cases the declaration of a variable resembles its usage in an expression whose type is the one named at the head of the declaration.\n\n\nIt appears this rule trumped parser considerations. Its immediate consequence is that function declarations can’t use specific keywords, or impose a different ordering of declaration components.\nIt’s worth noting that parsing was somewhat different in early C, since function declarations didn’t specify their arguments, and function definitions separated the argument list from the argument declarations (which weren’t necessary for ```int``` arguments):\n```sum();\n```\ndeclares a ```sum``` function, which would then be defined as\n```sum(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n(no types needed here, the default is ```int```). So the parser didn’t deal with types inside argument lists."

    "response": "You have been told how to get a curved L. But here's some more general advice, which also applies in this situation: In cases such as this, always create your own shortcut macro, say\n```\\newcommand{\\Lagr}{\\mathcal{L}}\n```\n\nThis way, if you ever decide that that curly L is not quite the one you like, it is easy to switch. Also, even before you knew the answer to this question, you could have written\n```\\newcommand{\\Lagr}{L}\n```\nin your preamble. Then you could start/continue writing the document, use ordinary capital Ls where you want, and ```\\Lagr``` wherever you actually mean a Lagrangian, and then later changing the definition of ```\\Lagr``` to something appropriate. This way, you wouldn't have to manually search for each occurence of a capital L and decide if it's a Lagrangian or not. Clearly ```\\Lagr``` (or whatever you want to call this macro) is also easier to type than ```\\mathcal{L}```, and it makes the source code much more readable.\n\nAnother advantage, which is probably more subtle, since you're new to LaTeX, is that we can make the curvy L exactly the type of math we want. TeX distinguishes between ordinary letters, binary operators, binary relations, opening and closing parenthesis and so on; the spacing between two ordinary letters is not the same as the spacing between the ```a```, ```+```, and ```b``` in ```$a+b$```. So since the Lagrangian is a kind of operator, we could say\n```\\newcommand{\\Lagr}{\\mathop{\\mathcal{L}}}\n```\n\nBut in the case of operators, the package amsmath (which you are most likely using; if not, you should) provides a somewhat better mechanism:\n```\\DeclareMathOperator{\\Lagr}{\\mathcal{L}}\n```\n\nAnother (related) tip: Even if you are using the same notation for two different things, it is best to make a separate macro for each. In this case you might have\n```\\DeclareMathOperator{\\Lagr}{\\mathcal{L}}\n\\DeclareMathOperator{\\Lapl}{\\mathcal{L}}\n```\nThe reason is the same as in the ```L``` vs. ```\\Lagr``` case above: If you at some point decide that using ```\\mathcal{L}``` for both is a bad idea, you would have to find each occurence of ```\\Lagr``` and figure out if it is really a Laplacian. Using macro names carrying semantic meaning is one of the great powers of TeX."

    "response": "In Arabic, in fact, they've always been separate sounds! The sound we write \"K\" is spelled with the letter ك in Arabic, and is pronounced a little bit further forward in the mouth; the sound we write \"Q\" is spelled with the letter ق and pronounced a little bit farther back. In phonetic terms, \"K\" is a velar sound, and \"Q\" is a uvular sound.\n\nEnglish doesn't distinguish between these two different sounds. But since we've got a spare letter lying around—the English letter \"Q\" is actually related to the Arabic letter ق, if you go back far enough!—it's become conventional to separate them in writing. \"Kuwait\" is spelled with a ك, so it gets a \"K\"; \"Qatar\" is spelled with a ق, so it gets a \"Q\". The \"Qur'an\", similarly, has a ق in it.\n\nNowadays, by the way, the letter \"Q\" has started to be associated with Arabic in particular, since it shows up significantly more there than in English. So in pop culture, you'll sometimes see names like \"Hakeem\" respelled to \"Haqim\"—even though the original Arabic has a ك in it! Linguistically, this is called hypercorrection, and it's the same reason you'll see words like \"forté\" with an é: English-speakers associate the acute accent with Romance loans (café, fiancé, résumé), but it has no special meaning in English, so it sometimes gets inserted where it doesn't actually belong (the original Italian word is simply forte)."

This is because",
    "response": "Além do custo ser mais alto como mencionado, deve-se levar em conta vários fatores:\n\n* Volume de dados: para um baixo volume de dados pode não haver problema. Por outro lado, para armazenamento de grande massa de dados o banco de dados é praticamente inviável. Pergunte ao Facebook ou ao Google se eles usariam banco. O Facebook, por exemplo, usa um sistema de arquivos personalizado para tornar o acesso mais rápido ainda e diminuir a o overhead por arquivo exigido pelos sistemas de arquivos tradicionais.\n* Clusterização: uma vantagem do banco de dados é no caso do seu sistema rodar em vários servidores, todos terão acesso uniforme aos arquivos. Porém, usar uma unidade na rede para armazenar os arquivos.\n* Disponibilidade: seu sistema vai ter muitos acessos? Isso pode sobrecarregar um banco de dados tradicional. Por outro lado, seu servidor HTTP pode usar as rotinas de acesso de baixo nível ao sistema de arquivos para enviar o stream de dados ao cliente.\n* Escalabilidade: se a demanda de volume ou disponibilidade aumentarem, será possível adicionar mais capacidade ao sistema? É muito mais fácil dividir arquivos entre servidores diferentes do que distribuir registros de uma tabela em mais servidores.\n* Flexibilidade: fazer cópias de segurança, mover arquivos de um servidor para outro, fazer algum processamento nos arquivos armazenados, tudo isso fica mais fácil se os arquivos estiverem num diretório. Se você faz o deploy em ambiente de cliente, os arquivos no disco não inviabilizam você de receber cópias do banco de dados para testes. Tente pedir para o seu cliente enviar terabytes de dados para você analisar se der algum problema no banco.\n* Overhead de leitura e gravação: o custo computacional para gravar e ler dados do banco de dados é maior do que para ler e gravar diretamente em um arquivo.\n\nExistem várias estratégias para escalar um sistema tanto em termos de disponibilidade quanto em volume. Basicamente essas estratégias consistem em distribui-los em vários vários servidores e redirecionar o usuário para cada um deles conforme algum critério. Os detalhes variam de implementação, tais como: estratégia de atualização dos dados, redundância, critérios de distribuição, etc.\nUma das grandes dificuldades em gerenciar arquivos fora do BD é que temos agora duas fontes de dados distintas e que precisam estar sempre em sincronia.\nDo ponto de vista de segurança, efetivamente há pouca diferença. Se um hacker pode comprometer um servidor, ele poderá ler tanto os arquivos gravados em disco do seu sistema quanto os arquivos do sistema de banco de dados. Se essa questão for crítica, uma alternativa é armazenar os dados criptografados.\nPorém, sempre que fiz a análise do melhor tipo de solução, o uso do sistema de arquivos sempre esteve em grande vantagem."

A 1999 phone, probably on 2g would likely use 900MHz (UHF). The slightly broken comms unit in the pod is probably using channel 16 or equivalent*. This is your first problem.

Another example would be that the tactics of boxing would be to knock out the other person first using only punches. So, as far as I know, the goal of Systema and Krav Maga are both to do anything you can to defeat your attacker because they are serious about self defense.

It is a very unconventional form of self-defence, as it is taught in a very short space of time, and uses a lot of very quick movements. It is based on the idea that you should not be afraid of anyone, and should not be afraid to attack anyone, as you have the natural instincts to do so. It teaches you how to control your fear and turn it into a useful tool in your defence.\n\nSystema is a more complex system of self-defence. It is a methodology that teaches you how to control your fear/anger/pity and how to use your natural responses and the clarity of mind gained from your training to your advantage in stressful situations. It is also very long-form, with a lot of training time, and is taught over a much longer period of time.\n\nThe main difference between Krav Maga and Systema is that Krav Maga is a very unconventional system of self-defence that teaches you how to control your fear/anger/pity and how to use your natural responses and the clarity of mind gained from your training to your advantage in stressful situations.

    "response": "At first glance Krav Maga and Systema seem to be very similar in that they are both very unconventional, no-rules, practical self-defence, martial arts (although Krav isn't technically a martial art) which are no holds barred and generally formless.\n\nHowever...\nKrav Maga is basically a very raw, dangerous situation survival system (including avoidance and escape) which builds upon your natural instincts and taught in a very short space of time.  Therefore it is highly stress tested.  It relies on the fact that fear will set in in order to use your natural responses and turn them into functional movements to your advantage. It relies heavily on shock and awe in that defence and attack should be simultaneous where possible to capitalise on the opponent's shock value.\n\nSystema is - in many ways - the exact opposite, it is a system which teaches over a much longer period of time how to control your fear/anger/pity and teaches relaxation (through breathing/stretching) in stressful situations so that attacks on your person are less effective, better recovered from and the pressure points, levers and momentum of attackers can be manipulated to your advantage using the clarity of mind gained from your training.\n\nIn Summary\nSo in effect Krav Maga is taught fast and turns your weaknesses into strengths so your defence/attack becomes like a reflex just when you need it, while Systema is a methodology that needs to be learned and seeks to remove those weaknesses so that your defense/attacks can be more effective.\n\nAlso, another martial art, similar and somewhere between these is the Keysi Fighting Method (KFM) - developed for street fighting - but that has some actual forms that have to be learned such as the very distinctive 'Pensador' that the Christian Bale Batman uses/\n\nKFM is a lot more like Krav Maga but it makes heavy use of the 'Pensador' guard (much like the 'Rhino' Krav pose) and concentrates a much larger chunk of its time to dealing with multiple opponents and ground based fighting, as it was developed for street fighting and this is where they tend to end up. It doesn't deal with survival (avoidance and get away) as much as Krav however. There are also no weapons."
